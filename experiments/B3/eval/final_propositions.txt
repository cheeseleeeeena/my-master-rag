If I were smart, I'd go home now.
Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.
In January 1941, Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation.
Franklin Roosevelt said he addressed the nation at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.
Hitler was on the march.
War was raging in Europe.
President Roosevelt's purpose was to wake up Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary time.
Freedom and democracy were under assault in the world.
The speaker comes to the same chamber to address the nation.
Now it's us who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union.
The purpose of the speaker tonight is to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment.
Not since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault at home as they are today.
The rare moment is that freedom and democracy are under attack both at home and overseas at the same time.
Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine.
Putin of Russia is sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.
[The speaker assured the audience that Putin will not stop at Ukraine.", "Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself.", "Ukraine is not asking for American soldiers.", "There are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine.", "The speaker is determined to keep it that way."]
Assistance to Ukraine is being blocked by those who want to walk away from our world leadership.
Ronald Reagan was a Republican president.
Ronald Reagan thundered, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'
Ronald Reagan was a Republican president.
A former Republican president, a former president, tells Putin, quote, 'Do whatever the hell you want.'
The quote is from a former Republican president.
A former president actually said that â€” bowing down to a Russian leader.
The former president's statement is outrageous, dangerous, and unacceptable.
America is a founding member of NATO.
NATO is the military alliance of democratic nations.
NATO was created after World War Two.

Sweden officially joined NATO this morning.
Sweden's minister is here tonight.

The message to President Putin is not to bow down.
In a literal sense, history is watching.
History is watching three years ago on January 6th.
Insurrectionists stormed the Capitol on January 6th.
Insurrectionists placed a dagger to the throat of American democracy.
Many of you were here on that darkest of days.
We all saw with our own eyes the insurrectionists were not patriots.
The insurrectionists had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power.
The insurrectionists had come to overturn the will of the people.
January 6th lies about the 2020 election.
The plots to steal the 2020 election posed a great threat to U.S. democracy since the Civil War.
The threat to democracy must be defended (defeated).
The speaker's predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6th.
The speaker will not bury the truth about January 6th.
