However, the individual modules such as face tracking, speaker identification and localization are trained using external datasets like VoxCeleb during initialization, but also integrated into the full system where they are utilized. Thus, the overall system includes multimodal inputs in a few different configurations, and is mostly trained or engineered using machine learning, but the actual integration as a whole is done programmatically."}
