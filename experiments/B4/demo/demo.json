    "Here is the description of the content within the 'Introduction' section:\n\n<<<The introduction of the paper \"End-to-End Trainable Non-Collaborative Dialog System\" sets the stage for the remainder of the paper by highlighting the difference between collaborative and non-collaborative dialog systems. It discusses how collaborative dialog systems have achieved notable successes in tasks where users work together with the system to achieve a common goal. In contrast, non-collaborative dialog systems, such as those found in negotiation and persuasion, do not share the same goal. The introduction notes that users in non-collaborative settings often employ social content to build rapport and trust, which is not explicitly addressed in current research. The authors aim to address this gap by introducing a hierarchical intent annotation scheme and a neural network model that generates diverse and coherent responses, which can be applied to various non-collaborative dialog tasks. The introduction provides a clear overview of the significance of this research and the contributions the authors aim to make.>>> \n\nPlease let me know if you need anything else! I'd be happy to help. \n\n(And if you'd like a description for another section, just let me know!) \n\nTime complexity: O(1), where the time complexity is constant since it's a description, not a computational operation. Space complexity: O(1), since it does not use any extra space. Non-existent runtime error: N/A, since there is no code involved. Efficiency: O(1), constant efficiency since it doesn't rely on input size or computational complexity. Let me know if you have any questions!
