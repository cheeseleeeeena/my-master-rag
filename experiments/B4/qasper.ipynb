Examples of collaborative tasks include making restaurant reservations and retrieving bus time-table information. Since users typically have clear and explicit intentions in collaborative tasks, existing systems commonly classify user utterances into pre-defined intents. In contrast, non-collaborative tasks are those where the users and the system do not strive to achieve the same goal. Examples of such tasks include deceiving attackers, persuading users to donate to a cause BIBREF1, and negotiating a product price BIBREF2, BIBREF3. In these tasks, users often perform complex actions that are beyond a simple set of pre-defined intents. In order to reach a common state, the user and the system need to build rapport and trust which naturally involves off-task content. Previous work did not model off-task content BIBREF2, which may have led to less optimal results. For example, in the persuasion task BIBREF1, users would ask the system “How do you feel about war?\" An example of an on-task system response that the system could have made is “Do you want to make a donation?\", which sticks to the task but neglects users\\' question. However, a better response to such an off-task question is “War is destructive and pitiless, but you can donate to help child victims of war.\" This response is better, as it has been found that users are more likely to end the conversation if the system neglects their questions BIBREF4.

To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision.

Our experiments show that the proposed features perform effectively and their efficiency allows them to detect rumours instantly after their publication.'}, '50': {'section_name': 'Conclusion', 'section_description': 'In conclusion, the proposed novelty-based approach, incorporating pseudo feedback, demonstrates significant improvement in detecting rumors instantly after their publication, as compared to other real-time methods. The novelty-based features, tailored to detect unconfirmed information with respect to news articles, effectively mitigate the limitation of traditional rumor detection systems, which rely on repeated signals. Furthermore, the pseudo feedback mechanism, treating documents similar to previous rumors as potential rumors, enhances the accuracy of the approach. The results highlight the importance of considering novel information and adapting to the dynamic nature of online discourse. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied in real-world scenarios, potentially preventing the spread of misinformation and the harm it can cause. The efficiency and scalability of the approach are also discussed, demonstrating its viability for practical use.', 'text': 'We introduced two new categories of features which significantly improve instantaneous rumour detection performance. Novelty based features consider the increased presence of unconfirmed information within a message with respect to trusted sources as an indication of being a rumour. Pseudo feedback features consider messages that are similar to previously detected rumours as more likely to also be a rumour. Pseudo feedback and its variant, recursive pseudo feedback, allow harnessing repeated signals without the need of operating retrospectively. Our evaluation showed that novelty and pseudo feedback based features perform significantly more effective than other real-time and early detection baselines, when detecting rumours instantly after their publication. This advantage vanishes when allowing an increased detection delay. We also showed that the proposed features can be computed efficiently enough to operate on the average Twitter and Sina Weibo stream while keeping time and space requirements constant.'}}\n"

    "    \"The overall pipeline of LadaBERT (Lightweight Adaptation of BERT) is illustrated in Figure FIGREF8. As shown in the figure, the pre-trained BERT model (e.g., BERT-Base) is served as the teacher as well as the initial status of the student model. Then, the student model is compressed towards smaller parameter size through a hybrid model compression framework in an iterative manner until the target compression ratio is reached. Concretely, in each iteration, the parameter size of student model is first reduced by $1-\\\\Delta $ based on weight pruning and matrix factorization, and then the parameters are fine-tuned by the loss function of knowledge distillation. The motivation behind is that matrix factorization and weight pruning are complementary with each other. Matrix factorization calculates the optimal approximation under a certain rank, while weight pruning introduces additional sparsity to the decomposed matrices. Moreover, weight pruning and matrix factorization generates better initial and intermediate status of the student model, which improve the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge distillation. In the following subsections, we will introduce the algorithms in detail.\",\n",

Recall that BERT-PKD initializes the student model by selecting 3 of 12 layers in the pre-trained BERT-Base model. It turns out that the discarded layers have huge impact on the model performance, which is hard to be recovered by knowledge distillation. On the other hand, LadaBERT generates the student model by iterative pruning on the pre-trained teacher. In this way, the original knowledge in the teacher model can be preserved to the largest extent, and the benefit of which is complementary to knowledge distillation.\",\n",

As shown in the figures, LadaBERT-3 achieves good performances much faster and results in a better convergence point. After training $2 \\\\times 10^4$ steps (batches) on MNLI-m dataset, the performance of LadaBERT-3 is already comparable to TinyBERT after convergence (approximately $2 \\\\times 10^5$ steps), achieving nearly $10 \\\\times $ acceleration. And on QQP dataset, both performance improvement and training speed acceleration is very significant. This clearly shows the superiority of combining matrix factorization, weight pruning and knowledge distillation in a reinforce manner. Instead, TinyBERT is based on pure knowledge distillation, so the learning speed is much slower.\",\n",

Especially, LadaBERT-1 outperforms BERT-PKD significantly under $2.5\\\\times $ compression ratio, and LadaBERT-3 outperforms TinyBERT under $7.5\\\\times $ compression ratio while the training speed is accelerated by an order of magnitude.\"\n",

    "    \"Morphological analysis already provides the aforementioned information about the words. However access to useful morphological features may be problematic due to software licensing issues, lack of robust morphological analyzers and high ambiguity among analyses. Character-level models (CLM), being a cheaper and accessible alternative to morphology, have been reported as performing competitively on various NLP tasks BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 . However the extent to which these tasks depend on morphology is small; and their relation to semantics is weak. Hence, little is known on their true ability to reveal the underlying morphological structure of a word and their semantic capabilities. Furthermore, their behaviour across languages from different families; and their limitations and strengths such as handling of long-range dependencies, reaction to model complexity or performance on out-of-domain data are unknown. Analyzing such issues is a key to fully understanding the character-level models.\",\n",
    "    \"We use a simple method based on bidirectional LSTMs to train three types of base semantic role labelers that employ (1) words (2) characters and character sequences and (3) gold morphological analysis. The gold morphology serves as the upper bound for us to compare and analyze the performances of character-level models on languages of varying morphological typologies. We carry out an exhaustive error analysis for each language type and analyze the strengths and limitations of character-level models compared to morphology. In regard to the diversity hypothesis which states that diversity of systems in ensembles lead to further improvement, we combine character and morphology-level models and measure the performance of the ensemble to better understand how similar they are.\",\n",
    "    \"Although models with access to gold morphological tags achieve better F1 scores than character models, they can be less useful a in real-life scenario since they require gold tags at test time. To predict the performance of morphology-level models in such a scenario, we train the same models with the same parameters with predicted morphological features. Predicted tags were only available for German, Spanish, Catalan and Czech. Our results given in Fig. 5 , show that (except for Czech), predicted morphological tags are not as useful as characters alone.\"\n",

    "    \"Here, char function simply splits the token into its characters. Similar to n-gram language models, char3 slides a character window of width $n=3$ over the token. Finally, gold morphological features are used as outputs of morph-language. Throughout this paper, we use morph and oracle interchangably, i.e., morphology-level models (MLM) have access to gold tags unless otherwise is stated. For all languages, morph outputs the lemma of the token followed by language specific morphological tags. As an exception, it outputs additional information for some languages, such as parts-of-speech tags for Turkish. Word segmenters such as Morfessor and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are other commonly used subword units. Due to low scores obtained from our preliminary experiments and unsatisfactory results from previous studies BIBREF13 , we excluded these units.\"\n",
