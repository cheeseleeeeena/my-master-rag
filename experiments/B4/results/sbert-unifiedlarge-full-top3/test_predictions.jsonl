The average conversation length is 12.45 turns and the average utterance length is 11.13 words. Only 172 out of 220 users successfully identified their partner as an attacker, suggesting that the attackers are well trained and not too easily identifiable.

There are many other non-collaborative tasks, such as the turn-taking game BIBREF6, the multi-party game BIBREF7 and item splitting negotiation BIBREF8. Similar to the AntiScam dataset proposed in this paper, these datasets contain off-task content and can be used to train non-collaborative dialog systems. However, since they are not specifically collected and designed for non-collaborative tasks, it might be difficult to disentangle the on-task and off-task contents and measure the performance. Therefore, we propose the AntiScam dataset, which is designed to interleave the on-task and off-task contents in the conversation, and can serve as a benchmark dataset for similar non-collaborative tasks.", "To enrich publicly available non-collaborative task datasets, we collect a new dataset AntiScam, where users defend themselves against attackers trying to collect personal information.

BIBREF9 hardy2002multi followed the DAMSL schemeBIBREF10 and annotated a multilingual human-computer dialog corpus with a hierarchical dialog act annotation scheme. BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks. We propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that can be adopted by all non-collaborative tasks. With this annotation scheme, MISSA is able to quickly build an end-to-end trainable dialog system for any non-collaborative task.", "To tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content. BIBREF4 used a rule-based dialog manager for on-task content and a neural model for off-task content, and trained a reinforcement learning model to select between these two models based on the dialog context. However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation. Off-task information, on the other hand, is too general to categorize into specific intents, so we choose dialog acts that convey syntax information. These acts, such as “open question\" are general to all tasks.", "In the intent annotation scheme shown in Table TABREF2, we list the designed intent annotation scheme for the newly collected AntiScam dataset and the PersuasionForGood dataset. We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold)."], "predicted_answer": "hierarchical intent annotation scheme"}

The idea of creating a summary by extracting words from the source document was pioneered in bankoetal00 who view summarization as a problem analogous to statistical machine translation and generate headlines using statistical models for selecting and ordering the summary words. Our word-based model is similar in spirit, however, it operates over continuous representations, produces multi-sentence output, and jointly selects summary words and organizes them into sentences. A few recent studies BIBREF14 , BIBREF15 perform sentence extraction based on pre-trained sentence embeddings following an unsupervised optimization paradigm. Our work also uses continuous representations to express the meaning of sentences and documents, but importantly employs neural networks more directly to perform the actual summarization task.", "In this work we presented a data-driven summarization framework based on an encoder-extractor architecture. We developed two classes of models based on sentence and word extraction. Our models can be trained on large scale datasets and learn informativeness features based on continuous representations without recourse to linguistic annotations.

After Concatenating sub-sentences, 7,347 labeled sentences were obtained.", "One of the crucial tasks for researchers to carry out scientific investigations is to detect existing ideas that are related to their research topics. Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works. Their scheme resulted seven categories of rhetorical status and the categories are assigned to full sentences. Examples of human annotated sentences with their rhetorical status are shown in Table. TABREF2 . The seven categories are aim, contrast, own, background, other, basis and textual.", "In this paper, different word embedding models on the task of argumentative zoning were compared .

As a complementary approach, BIBREF27 studied the attention mechanism of BERT, finding clear correlates with interpretable linguistic structures such as direct objects, and suggest that BERT's success is due in part to its syntactic awareness. However, by subjecting it to existing psycholinguistic tasks, BIBREF32 found that BERT fails in its ability to understand negation. In concurrent work, BIBREF33 show that BERT does not consistently outperform LSTM-based models on English subject-verb agreement tasks.", "Core linguistic phenomena depend on syntactic structure. Yet current state-of-the-art models in language representations, such as BERT, do not have explicit syntactic structural representations. Previous work by BIBREF17 showed that BERT captures English subject-verb number agreement well despite this lack of explicit structural representation. We replicated this result using a different evaluation methodology that addresses shortcomings in the original methodology and expanded the study to 26 languages. Our study further broadened existing work by considering the most cross-linguistically common agreement types as well as the most common morphosyntactic features. The main result of this expansion into more languages, types and features is that BERT, without explicit syntactic structure, is still able to capture syntax-sensitive agreement patterns well. However, our analysis highlights an important qualification of this result. We showed that BERT's ability to model syntax-sensitive agreement relations decreases slightly as the dependency becomes longer range, and as the number of distractors increases. We release our new curated cross-linguistic datasets and code in the hope that it is useful to future research that may probe why this pattern appears."], "predicted_answer": "yes"}

Preliminary qualitative results show that MagiCoder drastically reduces the amount of work required for the revision of a report, allowing the pharmacovigilance stakeholders to provide high quality data about suspected ADRs.", "Online reports have grown up to become the 30% of the total number of Italian reports. As expected, it has been possible to observe that the average time between the dispatch of online reports and the insertion into RNF is sensibly shorter with respect to the insertion from printed reports. Notwithstanding, there is an operation which still requires the manual intervention of responsibles for pharmacovigilance also for online report revisions: the encoding in MedDRA terminology of the free text, through which the reporter describes one or more adverse drug reactions. MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) is a medical terminology introduced with the purpose to standardize and facilitate the sharing of information about medicinal products in particular with respect to regulatory activities BIBREF5 . The description of a suspected ADR through narrative text could seem redundant/useless. Indeed, one could reasonably imagine sound solutions based either on an autocompletion form or on a menu with MedDRA terms. In these solutions, the description of ADRs would be directly encoded by the reporter and no expert work for MedDRA terminology extraction would be required. However, such solutions are not completely suited for the pharmacovigilance domain and the narrative description of ADRs remains a desirable feature, for at least two reasons. First, the description of an ADR by means of one of the seventy thousand MedDRA terms is a complex task. In most cases, the reporter who points out the adverse reaction is not an expert in MedDRA terminology. This holds in particular for citizens, but it is still valid for several professionals. Thus, describing ADRs by means of natural language sentences is simpler. Second, the choice of the suitable term(s) from a given list or from an autocompletion field can influence the reporter and limit her/his expressiveness. As a consequence, the quality of the description would be also in this case undermined. Therefore, VigiFarmaco offers a free-text field for specifying the ADR with all the possible details, without any restriction about the content or strict limits to the length of the written text. Consequently, MedDRA encoding has then to be manually implemented by qualified people responsible for pharmacovigilance, before the transmission to RNF. As this work is expensive in terms of time and attention required, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur given the continuous growing of the number of reports.", "To evaluate MagiCoder performances, we developed a benchmark, which automatically compares MagiCoder behavior with human encoding on already manually revised and validated ADR reports."], "predicted_answer": "yes"}

Clearly, as a set of official reports, revised and sent to RNF, we assume to deal with an high-quality encoding: notwithstanding, some errors in the human encoding possibly occur.

Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 . Second, unlike for some other severe mental health difficulties, return to normal functioning is achievable given appropriate treatment BIBREF28 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF29 .", "A substantial body of qualitative and quantitative research has shown the importance of personal recovery for individuals diagnosed with BD BIBREF22 , BIBREF25 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF23 .

Some quantitative evidence stems from the standardised bipolar recovery questionnaire BIBREF30 and a randomised control trial for recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy BIBREF31 . Critically, previous research has taken place only in structured settings. What is more, the recovery concept emerged from research primarily conducted in English-speaking countries, mainly involving researchers and participants of Western ethnicity. This might have led to a lack of non-Western notions of wellbeing in the concept, such as those found in indigenous peoples BIBREF32 , limiting its the applicability to a general population. Indeed, the variation in BD prevalence rates from 0.1% in India to 4.4% in the US is striking. It has been shown that culture is an important factor in the diagnosis of BD BIBREF33 , as well as on the causes attributed to mental health difficulties in general and treatments considered appropriate BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 .

This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment. Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised by recurring episodes of depressed and elated (hypomanic or manic) mood BIBREF25 , BIBREF12 . Bipolar spectrum disorders were estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK population BIBREF13 with rates ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other European, American and Asian countries BIBREF26 . Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 . Second, unlike for some other severe mental health difficulties, return to normal functioning is achievable given appropriate treatment BIBREF28 , BIBREF16 , BIBREF29 .", "A substantial body of qualitative and quantitative research has shown the importance of personal recovery for individuals diagnosed with BD BIBREF22 , BIBREF25 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF23 . Qualitative evidence mainly comes from (semi-)structured interviews and focus groups and has been criticised for small numbers of participants BIBREF10 , lacking complementary quantitative evidence from larger samples BIBREF32 . Some quantitative evidence stems from the standardised bipolar recovery questionnaire BIBREF30 and a randomised control trial for recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy BIBREF31 . Critically, previous research has taken place only in structured settings. What is more, the recovery concept emerged from research primarily conducted in English-speaking countries, mainly involving researchers and participants of Western ethnicity. This might have led to a lack of non-Western notions of wellbeing in the concept, such as those found in indigenous peoples BIBREF32 , limiting its the applicability to a general population. Indeed, the variation in BD prevalence rates from 0.1% in India to 4.4% in the US is striking. It has been shown that culture is an important factor in the diagnosis of BD BIBREF33 , as well as on the causes attributed to mental health difficulties in general and treatments considered appropriate BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 . While approaches to mental health classification from texts have long ignored the cultural dimension BIBREF36 , first studies show that online language of individuals affected by depression or related mental health difficulties differs significantly across cultures BIBREF37 , BIBREF36 .", "We plan to collect data relevant for BD in general as well as for personal recovery in BD from three sources varying in their available amount versus depth of the accounts we expect to find: 1) Twitter, 2) Reddit (focusing on mental health-related content unlike previous work), 3) blogs authored by affected individuals. Twitter and Reddit users with a BD diagnosis will be identified automatically via self-reported diagnosis statements, such as `I was diagnosed with BD-I last week'. To do so, we will extend on the diagnosis patterns and terms for BD provided by BIBREF47 . Implicit consent is assumed from users on these platforms to use their public tweets and posts.

In contrast to SHI, CI has nearly one thousand forms. Each form of CI (it is called Cipai scholarly) is defined by a fixed number of lines for the poem and, a fixed number of characters for a particular line which usually varies for different lines. The above settings for different Cipai are very distinct, for instance, the Cipai of Busuanzi contains 8 lines and 44 characters, as shown in Figure 2, whereas the Cipai of Manjianghong contains 22 lines and 94 characters.

We can also predict the target length ranging from $[(T_x+C)-B, (T_x+C)+B]$, where $B$ is the halfwidth. By doing this, we can obtain multiple translation results with different lengths.

However, the gap is much smaller for factoid QA datasets. Since non-factoid QA depends more on content matching rather than vocabulary matching, the results are kind of expected.

Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 .", "Modern society is an information society bombarded from all sides by an increasing number of different pieces of information. The 21st century has brought us the rapid development of media, especially in the internet ecosystem. This change has caused the transfer of many areas of our lives to virtual reality. New forms of communication have been established. Their development has created the need for analysis of related data. Nowadays, unstructured information is available in digital form, but how can we analyse and summarise billions of newly created texts that appear daily on the internet? Natural language analysis techniques, statistics and machine learning have emerged as tools to help us. In recent years, particular attention has focused on sentiment analysis. This area is defined as the study of opinions expressed by people as well as attitudes and emotions about a particular topic, product, event, or person. Sentiment analysis determines the polarisation of the text. It answers the question as to whether a particular text is a positive, negative, or neutral one.", "We have proposed a comprehensive flow of analysing aspects and assigning sentiment orientation to them. The advantages of such an analysis are that: it is a grammatically-based and coherent solution, it shows opinion distribution, it doesn't need any aspect ontology, it is not limited to the number of aspects and really important, it doesn't need training data (unsupervised method).

The result of this step was a set of Aspect-based Discourse Trees (ADTs). Then, from each ADT relations between aspects were extracted using breadth-first search, and an Aspect-Rhetorical Relation Graph (ARRG) was created by using aspects and relations such as nodes and edges respectively.

We explicitly group the set of these properties into two categories: syntactic and social. Syntactic category includes properties such as tweet length, the order of words in it, the words themselves, slang words, hashtags and named entities in the tweet. On the other hand, social properties consist of `is reply', and `reply time'. We investigate the degree to which the tweet representations encode these properties. We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model. Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task).

As an upper bound, we also included Gold standard summaries. The study was conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS; BIBREF42), a less labor-intensive alternative to paired comparisons that has been shown to produce more reliable results than rating scales BIBREF43.

They were also presented with three system summaries and asked to select the best and worst among them according to Informativeness (i.e., does the summary convey opinions about specific aspects of the movie in a concise manner?), Correctness (i.e., is the information in the summary factually accurate and does it correspond to the information given about the movie?), and Grammaticality (i.e., is the summary fluent and grammatical?). Examples of system summaries are shown in Figure FIGREF1 and Figure FIGREF37. We randomly selected 50 movies from the test set and compared all possible combinations of summary triples for each movie. We collected three judgments for each comparison.

They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Mulić BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian.

The question is whether Laszlo's idea of cybernetics would drive the research of the group towards artificial neural networks. Laszlo and his group do not go into neural network details (bear in mind that this is 1959, the time of Rosenblatt), but the following passage offers a strong suggestion about the idea they had (bearing in mind that Wiener relates McCulloch and Pitts' ideas in his book): \"Cybernetics is the scientific discipline which studies analogies between machines and living organisms\" (BIBREF11, p. 107). They fully commit to the idea two pages later (BIBREF11, p. 109): \"An important analogy is the one between the functioning of the machine and that of the human nervous system\". This could be taken to mean a simple computer brain analogy in the spirit of BIBREF14 and later BIBREF15, but Laszlo and Petrović specifically said that thinking of cybernetics as the \"theory of electronic computers\" (as they are made) is wrong BIBREF11, since the emphasis should be on modelling analogical processes. There is a very interesting quote from BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrović note that \"today, there is a significant effort in the world to make fully automated machine translation possible; to achieve this, logicians and linguists are making efforts on ever more sophisticated problems\". This seems to suggest that they were aware of the efforts of logicians (such as Bar Hillel, and to some degree Pitts, since Wiener specifically mentions logicians-turned-cyberneticists in his book BIBREF13), but still concluded that a cybernetic approach would probably be a better choice.", "Laszlo and Petrović BIBREF11 argued that, in order to trim the search space, the words would have to be coded so as to retain their information value but to rid the representations of needless redundancies. This was based on previous calculations of language entropy by Matković, and Matković's idea was simple: conduct a statistical analysis to determine the most frequent letters and assign them the shortest binary code. So A would get 101, while F would get 11010011 BIBREF11. Building on that, Laszlo suggested that, when making an efficient machine translation system, one has to take into account not just the letter frequencies but also the redundancies of some of the letters in a word BIBREF16. This suggests that the strategy would be as follows: first make a thesaurus, and pick a representative for each meaning, then stem or lemmatize the words, then remove the needless letters from words (i.e. letters that carry little information, such as vowels, but being careful not to equate two different words), and then encode the words in binary strings, using the letter frequencies. After that, the texts are ready for translation, but unfortunately, the translation method is never explicated. Nevertheless, it is hinted that it should be \"cybernetic\", which, along with what we have presented earlier, would most probably mean artificial neural networks. This is highlighted by the following passage (BIBREF11, p. 117):", "\"A man who spends 50 years in a lively and multifaceted mental activity hears a billion and a half words. For a machine to have an ability comparable to such an intellectual, not just in terms of speed but also in terms of quality, it has to have a memory and a language sense of the same capacity, and for that - which is paramount - it has to have in-built conduits for concept association and the ability to logically reason and verify, in a word, the ability to learn fast.\""], "predicted_answer": "artificial neural networks"}

Following the footsteps of Andreev, their interaction should be over an idealized language. Laszlo BIBREF16 notes that such an idealized language should be encoded by keeping the entropy in mind.

We could speculate that sub-symbolic processing would have been acceptable too, since that approach is also rooted in philosophical logic as a way of formalizing human cognitive functions and is also \"internal\" in the same sense symbolic approaches are.", "As noted earlier, the group had no computer available to build a prototype, and subsequently, they have underestimated the complexity of determining sentential alignment. Sentential alignment seems rather trivial from a theoretical standpoint, but it could be argued that machine translation can be reduced to sentential alignment. This reduction vividly suggests the full complexity of sentential alignment. But the complexity of alignment was not evident at the time, and only several decades after the Croatian group's dissolution, in the late 1990s, did the group centered around Tillmann and Ney start to experiment with statistical models using (non-trivial) alignment modules, and producing state-of-the-art results (cf. BIBREF24) and BIBREF25. However, this was statistical learning, and it would take another two decades for sentential alignment to be implemented in cybernetic models, by then known under a new name, deep learning. Alignment was implemented in deep neural networks by BIBREF26 and BIBREF27, but a better approach, called attention, which is a trainable alignment module, was being developed in parallel, starting with the seminal paper on attention in computer vision by BIBREF28."], "predicted_answer": "symbolic, causal, inductive, inductive"}

Descartes describes universal language as a simplified version of the language which will serve as an “interlanguage” for translation. That is, if we want to translate from English to Croatian, we will firstly translate from English to an “interlanguage”, and then from the “interlanguage” to Croatian.

Torok BIBREF12 used a grounded theory approach to develop an explanatory model for the radicalization process utilizing concepts of psychiatric power. Their findings show that the process typically starts with the social isolation of individuals. This isolation seems to be self-imposed as individuals tend to spend a long time engaging with radical content. This leads to the concept of homophily, the tendency to interact and associate with similar others. Through constant interaction with like-minded people, an individual gradually strengthens their mindset and progresses to more extreme levels. Similarly, they start to feel as being part of a group with a strong group identity which leads to group polarization. In psychology, group polarization occurs when discussion leads the group to adopt actions that are more extreme than the initial actions of the individual group members BIBREF13 . Moreover, the National Police Service Agency of the Netherlands developed a model to describe the phases a Jihadist may pass through before committing an act of terrorism BIBREF14 . These sequential phases of radicalism include strong links between the person's psychological and emotional state (e.g., social alienation, depression, lack of confidence in authority) and their susceptibility to radicalization.", "As illustrated in Fig. FIGREF1 , our approach consists of two main phases: Phase 1:Radical Properties Extraction, where articles from Dabiq extremist magazines are input into this step to perform two parallel tasks. In the first task, we build a language model using (i) Term-Frequency Inverse-Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) scores of uni-, bi-, and tri-grams, and (ii) Word embeddings generated from a word2vec model BIBREF15 . The output of this task is a radical corpus of top k-grams, and a word embedding model giving a vector representation for each word in the corpus. The second task seeks to create a psychological profile based on the language used in the extremist propaganda articles, consisting of a set of emotional and topical categories using LIWC dictionary-based tool. Phase 2: Tweet classification involves the use of the models generated from Phase 1 to engineer features related to radical activities.

Our intuition is that utilising these linguistic cues from the extremist propaganda would allow us to detect supporters of ISIS group who are influenced by their propaganda.", "We use two methods to extract the radical language from the propaganda corpus. First we calculate tf-idf scores for each gram in the propaganda corpus. We use uni-grams, bi-grams, and tri-grams to capture phrases and context in which words are being used. We then select the top scoring grams to be used as features for the language model. N-grams and words frequency have been used in the literature to classify similar problems, such as hate-speech and extremist text and have proven successful BIBREF16 . The second method we use is word embeddings to capture semantic meanings. Research in NLP has compared the effectiveness of word embedding methods for encoding semantic meaning and found that semantic relationships between words are best captured by word vectors within word embedding models BIBREF17 . Therefore, we train word2vec model on our propaganda corpus to build the lexical semantic aspects of the text using vector space models. We learn word embeddings using skip-gram word2vec model implemented in the gensim package with vector size of 100 and window size of 5. This word embedding model is used to obtain the vector representation for each word. We aggregate the vectors for each word in the tweet, and concatenate the maximum and average for each word vector dimension, such that any given tweet is represented in 200 dimension sized vector. This approach of aggregating vectors was used successfully in previous research BIBREF18 . Moreover, since ISIS supporters typically advocate for violent behaviour and tend to use offensive curse words, we use dictionaries of violent words and curse words to record the ratio of such words in the tweet. We also count the frequency of words with all capital letters as they are traditionally used to convey yelling behaviour.", "Building on the findings of previous research efforts, this paper aims to study the effects of using new textual and psycholinguistic signals to detect extremist content online. These signals are developed based on insights gathered from analyzing propaganda material published by known extremist groups. In this study, we focus mainly on the ISIS group as they are one of the leading terrorist groups that utilise social media to share their propaganda and recruit individuals. We analyze the propaganda material they publish in their online English magazine called Dabiq, and use data-mining techniques to computationally uncover contextual text and psychological properties associated with these groups. From our analysis of these texts, we are able to extract a set of signals that provide some insight into the mindset of the radical group.

For example, note how in the results for the Medical domain-specific model (first row in Table TABREF28), the BLEU scores on the Law and IT test sets are much higher in comparison to those on the Koran and Subtitles test sets, which clusters are farther away in the visualized embedding space. Similarly, as the Subtitles cluster (Blue) is closer to the Koran cluster (Green), the highest cross-domain BLEU score on the Koran test set is from the Subtitles model. To further quantify this phenomenon, we plot and measure Pearson's correlation between the cosine similarity of the centroids for the English BERT-based dev sentence representations for each domain pair, and the cross-domain BLEU score for this domain pair. This is shown in Figure FIGREF29. We can see the general trend where the closer the domain centroids are (with a similarity of 1 for training and evaluating on the same domain), the higher the cross-domain BLEU is between those domains, resulting in a Pearson's correlation of 0.81 (strong correlation).

For this reason, a major challenge when building such systems is obtaining data in the domain of interest. But what defines a domain? Natural language varies greatly across topics, styles, levels of formality, genres and many other linguistic nuances BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2. This overwhelming diversity of language makes it hard to find the right data for the task, as it is nearly impossible to well-define the exact requirements from such data with respect to all the aforementioned aspects. On top of that, domain labels are usually unavailable – e.g. in large-scale web-crawled data like Common Crawl which was recently used to train state-of-the-art pretrained language models for various tasks BIBREF3.", "The definition of domain is many times vague and over-simplistic (e.g. “medical text” may be used for biomedical research papers and for clinical conversations between doctors and patients, although the two vary greatly in topic, formality etc.). A common definition treats a domain as a data source: “a domain is defined by a corpus from a specific source, and may differ from other domains in topic, genre, style, level of formality, etc.” BIBREF8. We claim that a more data-driven definition should take place, as different data sources may have sentences with similar traits and vice versa - a single massive web-crawled corpus contains texts in numerous styles, topics and registers. Our analysis in Section SECREF2 shows examples for such cases, e.g. a sentence discussing “Viruses and virus-like organisms” in a legal corpus.", "As can be seen in Figure FIGREF15, in some areas the domains are somewhat overlapping in the embedding space, which may lead to outlier cases where examples from one domain are assigned to a cluster of a another domain. We plot a confusion matrix (Figure FIGREF20) to analyze this further based on the clustering with BERT-base and k=5. We first note that the outlier sentences are much shorter than the average sentence length in the corpus (11.62 tokens on average for outliers vs. 20.5 tokens on average in general). This makes sense as shorter sentences contain less information, making it harder to assign them to an appropriate cluster. Table TABREF19 shows examples of outlier sentences, assigned to clusters of domains different from their originating domain. We can see that in many cases the assignments are sensible – for example for sentences originating from the subtitles corpus, a sentence that mentions “great priest” is assigned to the Koran cluster, a sentence that mentions “The International Criminal Court in The Hague” is assigned to the Law cluster, a sentence that mentions “the virus” is assigned to the Medical cluster and so on.

The two style transfer methods (MAST and AdvST) fail the expectation, as their content fidelity performance is greatly inferior or merely comparable to the rule-based method. This is partially because these models are built on a different task assumption (i.e., modifying independent textual attributes) and cannot manipulate content well. In comparison, our proposed model achieves better content precision/recall, substantially improving over other methods (e.g., with a 15-point precision boost in comparison with the rule-based baseline) except for AttnCopy-S2S which has failed in style control. Our method also manages to preserve a high BLEU score of over 80. The superior performance of the full model compared to the variant Ours-w/o-Coverage demonstrates the usefulness of the content coverage constraint (Eq. EQREF15 ). By explicitly encouraging the model to mention each of the data tuples exactly once—a common pattern of human-written descriptions—the model achieves higher content fidelity with less style-preservation ability “sacrificed”.", "We have proposed a new and practical task of text content manipulation which aims to generate a sentence that describes desired content from a structured record (content fidelity) and meanwhile follows the writing style of a reference sentence (style preservation). To study the unsupervised problem, we derived a new dataset, and developed a method with competing learning objectives and an explicit coverage constraint. For empirical study, we devised two automatic metrics to measure different aspects of model performance. Both automatic and human evaluations showed superiority of the proposed approach."], "predicted_answer": "explicitly encouraging the model to mention each of the data tuples exactly once"}

To fuse text and image information, existing methods BIBREF8, BIBREF9 typically choose to directly concatenate image and global sentence features along the channel direction. Albeit simple, the above heuristic may suffer from some potential issues. Firstly, the model cannot precisely correlate fine-grained words with corresponding visual attributes that need to be modified, leading to inaccurate and coarse modification. For instance, shown in the first row of Fig. FIGREF1, both models cannot generate detailed visual attributes like black eye rings and a black bill. Secondly, the model cannot effectively identify text-irrelevant contents and thus fails to reconstruct them, resulting in undesirable modification of text-irrelevant parts in the image. For example, in Fig. FIGREF1, besides modifying the required attributes, both models BIBREF8, BIBREF9 also change the texture of the bird (first row) and the structure of the scene (second row).", "where diff is the $L_{1}$ pixel difference between the input image and the corresponding modified image, sim is the text-image similarity, which is calculated by using pretrained text and image encoders BIBREF16 based on a text-image matching score to extract global feature vectors of a given text description and the corresponding modified image, and then the similarity value is computed by applying cosine similarity between these two global vectors. Specifically, the design is based on the intuition that if the manipulated image is generated from an identity mapping network, then the text-image similarity should be low, as the synthetic image cannot perfectly keep a semantic consistency with the given text description.", "Text-guided image manipulation.

Since using existing lexical resources guarantees a high precision, it may also provide a low recall due to the limitedness of lexical resources in different languages and domains. A different approach to expand English WordNet synsets with lexicalizations in other languages was proposed in BIBREF51 . The authors do not directly match concepts in the two different language resources, but demonstrate an approach that learns how to determine the best translation for English synsets by taking bilingual dictionaries, structural information of the English WordNet and corpus frequency information into account. With the growing amount of parallel data, BIBREF52 show an approach to acquire a set of synsets from parallel corpora. The synsets are obtained by comparing aligned words in parallel corpora in several languages. Similarly, the sloWNet for Slovene BIBREF53 and Wolf for French BIBREF12 are constructed using a multilingual corpus and word alignment techniques in combination with other existing lexical resources. Since all these approaches use word alignment information, they are not able to generate any translation equivalents for multi-word expressions (MWE). In contrast, our approach use an SMT system trained on a large amount of parallel sentences, which allows us to align possible MWEs, such as commercial loan or take a breath, between source and target language. Furthermore, we engage the idea of identifying relevant contextual information to support an SMT system translating short expressions, which showed better performance compared to approaches without a context. BIBREF54 built small domain-specific translation models for ontology translation from relevant sentence pairs that were identified in a parallel corpus based on the ontology labels to be translated. With this approach they improve the translation quality over the usage of large generic translation models. Since the generation of translation models can be computational expensive, BIBREF55 use large generic translation models to translate ontology labels, which were placed into a disambiguated context. With this approach the authors demonstrate translation quality improvement over commercial systems, like Microsoft Translator. Different from this approach, which uses the hierarchical structure of the ontology for disambiguation, we engage a large number of different languages to identify the relevant context.", " BIBREF56 present a method for WordNet construction and enlargement with the help of sense tagged parallel corpora. Since parallel sense tagged data are not always available, they use Google Translate to translate a manually sense tagged corpus. In addition they apply automatic sense tagging of a manually translated parallel corpus, whereby they report worse performance compared to the previous approach. We try to overcome this issue by engaging up to ten languages to improve the performance of the automatic sense tagging. Similarly, BabelNet BIBREF5 aligns the lexicographic knowledge from WordNet to the encyclopaedic knowledge of Wikipedia. This is done by assigning WordNet synsets to Wikipedia entries, and making these relations multilingual through the interlingual links. For languages, which do not have the corresponding Wikipedia entry, the authors use Google Translate to translate English sentences containing the synset in the sense annotated corpus. After that, the most frequent translation is included as a variant for the synset for the given language.", "Once we obtain a set of sense disambiguated sentences for each Wordnet entry, we start the translation approach. Our hunch is that correctly identified contextual information around the WordNet entry can guide the SMT system to correctly translate an ambiguous entry."], "predicted_answer": "by 2x"}

Conversely, models tend to assign lower log probability scores to sentences with doubled datives, likely because these sentences lack either a nominative or an accusative, both of which are more frequent than dative. This leads to better than human performance on this case violation. Such behavior is probably due to the fact that German being a non pro-drop language, every verb must have a nominative case, making nominative more frequent than accusative, and that dative even rarer.

DeepWordBug used a scoring function to determine important tokens and then applied character-level transformations to those tokens.

The semantics of the text may be irreversibly changed if excessive misspellings are introduced to fool the target classifier.

Since the factored models have lemma, PoS tag and the separator `|` for each word, sequence lengths should be close to 3 times the non-factored counterparts.

The results are obtained using pyrouge package. The performance of various models and our improvements are summarized in Table TABREF37. A direct implementation of NSE performed very poorly due to the simple dot-product attention mechanism. In NMT, a transformation from word-vectors in one language to another one (say English to French) using a mere matrix multiplication is enough because of the one-to-one correspondence between words and the underlying linear structure imposed in learning the word vectors BIBREF23. However, in text summarization a word (sentence) could be a condensation of a group of words (sentences). Therefore, using a complex neural network-based attention mechanism proposed improved the performance. Both dot-product and additive BIBREF11 mechanisms perform similarly for the NMT task, but the difference is more pronounced for the text summarization task simply because of the nature of the problem as described earlier. Replacing Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) in the NSE with an LSTM further improved the performance because it remembers what was previously composed and facilitates the composition of novel words. This also eliminates the need for additional mechanisms to penalize repetitions such as coverage BIBREF2 and intra-attention BIBREF18.

In the French-English to Uzbek-English example, as a result of the initialization, the English word embeddings from the parent model are copied, but the Uzbek words are initially mapped to random French embeddings. The English embeddings should be kept but the Uzbek embeddings should be modified during training of the child model.

Two factors may explain this discrepancy: the Mboshi5k data being different from the training data of the MBN neural network, the neural network may not generalize well. Another possibility may be that the initialization scheme of the model is not suitable for this type of features. Indeed, Variational Bayesian Inference algorithm converges only to a local optimum of the objective function and is therefore dependent of the initialization.

Our method only allows for there to be an equal number of male and female names, but if this were not the case one ought to explore the possibility of a many-to-one mapping, or perhaps a probablistic approach (though difficulties would be encountered sampling simultaneously from two distributions, frequency and gender-specificity). A mapping between nicknames (not covered by administrative sources) and formal names could be learned from a corpus for even wider coverage, possibly via the intermediary of coreference chains. Finally, given that names have been used in psychological literature as a proxy for race (e.g. BIBREF12), the Names Intervention could also be used to mitigate racial biases (something which, to the authors' best knowledge, has never been attempted), but finding pairings could prove problematic. It is important that other work looks into operationalising bias beyond the subspace definition proposed by BIBREF1, as it is becoming increasingly evident that gender bias is not linear in embedding space.", "We fixedly associate pairs of names for swapping, thus expanding BIBREF5's short list of gender pairs vastly. Clearly both name frequency and the degree of gender-specificity are relevant to this bipartite matching. If only frequency were considered, a more gender-neutral name (e.g. Taylor) could be paired with a very gender-specific name (e.g. John), which would negate the gender intervention in many cases (namely whenever a male occurrence of Taylor is transformed into John, which would also result in incorrect pronouns, if present). If, on the other hand, only the degree of gender-specificity were considered, we would see frequent names (like James) being paired with far less frequent names (like Sybil), which would distort the overall frequency distribution of names. This might also result in the retention of a gender signal: for instance, swapping a highly frequent male name with a rare female name might simply make the rare female name behave as a new link between masculine contexts (instead of the original male name), as it rarely appears in female contexts."], "predicted_answer": "bipartite matching"}

While this kind of E2E approach significantly simplifies the speech recognition pipeline, the weakness is that it is difficult to tune the strength of each component. One particular problem from our observations is that the attention based E2E model tends to make grammatical errors, which indicates that the language modeling power of the model is weak, possibly due to the small amount of training data, or the mismatch between the training and evaluation data. However, due to the jointly model approach in the attention model, it is unclear how to improve the strength of the language modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the previous output tokens in the decoder, or to improve the strength of the acoustic modeling power, i.e., attributing more weights to the context vector from the encoder.", "In principle, our approach is applicable to the attention-based E2E framework with any type of neural network encoder.

In contrast, the rich body of works in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and other Natural Language Processing (NLP) related tasks have been largely left untouched. Recall that CV deep learning networks and NMT deep learning networks are very different. For instance, the convolutional network that forms the basis of many successful CV deep learning networks is translation invariant, e.g., in a face recognition network, the convolutional filters produce the same response even when the same face is shifted or translated. In contrast, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) BIBREF12, BIBREF13 and transformer-based deep learning networks BIBREF14, BIBREF15 for NMT are specifically looking patterns in sequences. There is no guarantee that the results from the CV based studies can be carried across to NMT. There is also a lack of awareness in the NMT community when it comes to optimizers and other related issues such as learning rate policy and batch size. It is often assumed that using the mainstream optimizer (Adam) with the default settings is good enough. As our study shows, there is significant room for improvement.", "The other hyperparameter to take care of is the learning rate decay rate, shown in Figure FIGREF8.

These works attempt to answer the question: what is the best step size to use in each step of the gradient descent? With the first order gradient descent being the de facto standard in deep learning optimization, the question of the optimal step size or learning rate in each step of the gradient descent arises naturally. The difficulty in choosing a good learning rate can be better understood by considering the two extremes: 1) when the learning rate is too small, training takes a long time; 2) while overly large learning rate causes training to diverge instead of converging to a satisfactory solution."], "predicted_answer": "learning rate decay policies improves learning rate convergence, while choosing the right learning rate policy can affect"}

Specifically, we can translate sentences such as the Hungarian “ő egy ápolónő”, where “ápolónő” translates to “nurse” and “ő” is a gender-neutral pronoun meaning either he, she or it, to English, yielding in this example the result “she's a nurse” on Google Translate. As Figure FIGREF1 clearly shows, the same template yields a male pronoun when “nurse” is replaced by “engineer”. The same basic template can be ported to all other gender neutral languages, as depicted in Table TABREF4 . Given the success of Google Translate, which amounts to 200 million users daily, we have chosen to exploit its API to obtain the desired thermometer of gender bias. Also, in order to solidify our results, we have decided to work with a fair amount of gender neutral languages, forming a list of these with help from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) BIBREF30 and other sources. Table TABREF2 compiles all languages we chose to use, with additional columns informing whether they (1) exhibit a gender markers in the sentence and (2) are supported by Google Translate. However, we stumbled on some difficulties which led to some of those langauges being removed, which will be explained in . There is a prohibitively large class of nouns and adjectives that could in principle be substituted into our templates. To simplify our dataset, we have decided to focus our work on job positions – which, we believe, are an interesting window into the nature of gender bias –, and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of professional occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' detailed occupations table BIBREF31 , from the United States Department of Labor. The values inside, however, had to be expanded since each line contained multiple occupations and sometimes very specific ones. Fortunately this table also provided a percentage of women participation in the jobs shown, for those that had more than 50 thousand workers. We filtered some of these because they were too generic ( “Computer occupations, all other”, and others) or because they had gender specific words for the profession (“host/hostess”, “waiter/waitress”). We then separated the curated jobs into broader categories (Artistic, Corporate, Theatre, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF3 . Finally, Table TABREF5 shows thirty examples of randomly selected occupations from our dataset. For the occupations that had less than 50 thousand workers, and thus no data about the participation of women, we assumed that its women participation was that of its upper category. Finally, as complementary evidence we have decided to include a small subset of 21 adjectives in our study. All adjectives were obtained from the top one thousand most frequent words in this category as featured in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, but it was necessary to manually curate them because a substantial fraction of these adjectives cannot be applied to human subjects. Also because the sentiment associated with each adjective is not as easily accessible as for example the occupation category of each job position, we performed a manual selection of a subset of such words which we believe to be meaningful to this study. These words are presented in Table TABREF6 . We made all code and data used to generate and compile the results presented in the following sections publicly available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/marceloprates/Gender-Bias. Note however that because the Google Translate algorithm can change, unfortunately we cannot guarantee full reproducibility of our results. All experiments reported here were conducted on April 2018.", "Averaged over occupations and languages, sentences are translated with female pronouns INLINEFORM0 of the time. In contrast, the gender participation frequency for female workers averaged over all occupations in the BLS report yields a consistently larger figure of INLINEFORM1 . The variance reported for the translation results is also lower, at INLINEFORM2 in contrast with the report's INLINEFORM3 . We ran an one-sided t-test to evaluate the null hypothesis that the female participation frequency is not significantly greater then the GT female pronoun frequency for the same job positions, obtaining a p-value INLINEFORM4 vastly inferior to our confidence level of INLINEFORM5 and thus rejecting H0 and concluding that Google Translate's female translation frequencies sub-estimates female participation frequencies in US job positions. As a result, it is not possible to understand this asymmetry as a reflection of workplace demographics, and the prominence of male defaults in Google Translate is, we believe, yet lacking a clear justification.", "In this paper, we have provided evidence that statistical translation tools such as Google Translate can exhibit gender biases and a strong tendency towards male defaults. Although implicit, these biases possibly stem from the real world data which is used to train them, and in this context possibly provide a window into the way our society talks (and writes) about women in the workplace. In this paper, we suggest that and test the hypothesis that statistical translation tools can be probed to yield insights about stereotypical gender roles in our society – or at least in their training data. By translating professional-related sentences such as “He/She is an engineer” from gender neutral languages such as Hungarian and Chinese into English, we were able to collect statistics about the asymmetry between female and male pronominal genders in the translation outputs. Our results show that male defaults are not only prominent, but exaggerated in fields suggested to be troubled with gender stereotypes, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) occupations. And because Google Translate typically uses English as a lingua franca to translate between other languages (e.g. Chinese INLINEFORM0 English INLINEFORM1 Portuguese) BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 , our findings possibly extend to translations between gender neutral languages and non-gender neutral languages (apart from English) in general, although we have not tested this hypothesis."], "predicted_answer": "no"}

First, it allows us to estimate the size of corpus required to train hypothetical inference methods for the science exam domain capable of producing explanations. If a given inference method can work successfully with only minimal overlap (for example, 1 shared table row), then a training corpus of 500 explanations in this domain should be sufficient to answer 80% of questions. If an inference method requires 2 shared rows, the corpus requirements would increase to approximately 2,500 questions to answer 80% of questions. However, if an inference method requires 3 or more rows, this likely would not be possible without a corpus of at least 20,000 questions and explanations – a substantial undertaking.

Existing approaches basically adopt look-up strategies and use standard local features, such as part-of-speech tags, previous and next words, substrings, shapes and regex expressions, for instance. The main drawback is the performance of those models with noisy data, such as Tweets. A major reason is that they rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain-specific knowledge. In terms of architecture, NER algorithms may also be designed based on generative (e.g., Naive Bayes) or discriminative (e.g., MaxEnt) models. Furthermore, sequence models (HMMs, CMM, MEMM and CRF) are a natural choice to design such systems. A more recent study proposed by Lample et al., 2016 BIBREF9 used neural architectures to solve this problem. Similarly in terms of architecture, Al-Rfou et al., 2015 BIBREF10 had also proposed a model (without dependency) that learns distributed word representations (word embeddings) which encode semantic and syntactic features of words in each language. Chiu and Nichols, 2015 BIBREF11 proposed a neural network architecture that automatically detects word and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN. Thus, these models work without resorting to any language-specific knowledge or resources such as gazetteers. They, however, focused on newswire to improve current state-of-the-art systems and not on the microblogs context, in which they are naturally harder to outperform due to the aforementioned issues.

The model achieved a recall of INLINEFORM0 on the flame messages, and INLINEFORM1 on the non-flame ones in the test set. Spertus noted some limitations of adopting a heuristic rule-based approach, e.g., the inability to deal with sarcasm, and vulnerability to errors in spelling, punctuation and grammar. Yin et al. Yin09detectionof developed a method for detecting online harassment. Working with the three data-harass datasets, they extracted local features (tf–idf weights of words), sentiment-based features (tf–idf weights of foul words and pronouns) and contextual features (e.g., similarity of a post to its neighboring posts) to train a linear support vector machine (svm) classifier. The authors concluded that important contextual indicators (such as harassment posts generally being off-topic) cannot be captured by local features alone. Their approach achieved INLINEFORM2 F INLINEFORM3 on the MySpace dataset, INLINEFORM4 F INLINEFORM5 on the Slashdot dataset, and INLINEFORM6 F INLINEFORM7 on the Kongregate dataset."], "predicted_answer": "no"}

It consisted of INLINEFORM0 private messages written in English from the web-masters of controversial web resources such as NewtWatch. These messages were marked as flame (containing insults or abuse; INLINEFORM1 ), maybe flame ( INLINEFORM2 ), or okay ( INLINEFORM3 ). We refer to this dataset as data-smokey. Yin et al. Yin09detectionof constructed three English datasets and annotated them for harassment, which they defined as “systematic efforts by a user to belittle the contributions of other users\". The samples were taken from three social media platforms: Kongregate ( INLINEFORM4 posts; INLINEFORM5 harassment), Slashdot ( INLINEFORM6 posts; INLINEFORM7 harassment), and MySpace ( INLINEFORM8 posts; INLINEFORM9 harassment). We refer to the three datasets as data-harass. Several datasets have been compiled using samples taken from portals of Yahoo!, specifically the News and Finance portals. Djuric et al. djuric created a dataset of INLINEFORM10 user comments in English from the Yahoo! Finance website that were editorially labeled as either hate speech ( INLINEFORM11 ) or clean (data-yahoo-fin-dj). Nobata et al. nobata produced four more datasets with comments from Yahoo! News and Yahoo! Finance, each labeled abusive or clean: 1) data-yahoo-fin-a: INLINEFORM12 comments, 7.0% abusive; 2) data-yahoo-news-a: INLINEFORM13 comments, 16.4% abusive; 3) data-yahoo-fin-b: INLINEFORM14 comments, 3.4% abusive; and 4) data-yahoo-news-b: INLINEFORM15 comments, 9.7% abusive.", "Wulczyn et al. wulczyn annotated English Talk page comments from a dump of the full history of Wikipedia and released three datasets: one focusing on personal attacks ( INLINEFORM0 comments; INLINEFORM1 abusive), one on aggression ( INLINEFORM2 comments), and one on toxicity ( INLINEFORM3 comments; INLINEFORM4 abusive) (data-wiki-att, data-wiki-agg, and data-wiki-tox respectively). data-wiki-agg contains the exact same comments as data-wiki-att but annotated for aggression – the two datasets show a high correlation in the nature of abuse (Pearson's INLINEFORM5 ). Gao and Huang gao2017detecting released a dataset of INLINEFORM6 Fox News user comments (data-fox-news) annotated as hateful ( INLINEFORM7 ) or non-hateful.

Van Hee et al. vanhee gathered INLINEFORM0 Dutch posts from ask.fm to form a dataset on cyber-bullying (data-bully; INLINEFORM1 cyber-bullying cases). Pavlopoulos et al. pavlopoulos-emnlp released a dataset of ca. INLINEFORM2 comments in Greek provided by the news portal Gazzetta (data-gazzetta). The comments were marked as accept or reject, and are divided into 6 splits with similar distributions (the training split is the largest one: INLINEFORM3 accepted and INLINEFORM4 rejected comments). As part of the GermEval shared task on identification of offensive language in German tweets BIBREF8 , a dataset of INLINEFORM5 tweets was released, of which INLINEFORM6 were labeled as abuse, INLINEFORM7 as insult, INLINEFORM8 as profanity, and INLINEFORM9 as other.

Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse. This is illustrated in the works of Dadvar et al. davdar and Waseem and Hovy waseemhovy: Dadvar et al. observed an inter-annotator agreement of INLINEFORM0 on their cyber-bullying dataset. Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks. On the other hand, Waseem and Hovy noted that INLINEFORM1 of all the disagreements in annotation of their dataset occurred on the sexism class. Sexism is typically both generalized and implicit.", "Online abuse stands as a significant challenge before society. Its nature and characteristics constantly evolve, making it a complex phenomenon to study and model. Automated abuse detection methods have seen a lot of development in recent years: from simple rule-based methods aimed at identifying directed, explicit abuse to sophisticated methods that can capture rich semantic information and even aspects of user behavior. By comprehensively reviewing the investigated methods to date, our survey aims to provide a platform for future research, facilitating progress in this important area. While we see an array of challenges that lie ahead, e.g., modeling extra-propositional aspects of language, user behavior and wider conversation, we believe that recent progress in the areas of semantics, dialogue modeling and social media analysis put the research community in a strong position to address them. Summaries of public datasets In table TABREF4 , we summarize the datasets described in this paper that are publicly available and provide links to them. A discussion of metrics The performance results we have reported highlight that, throughout work on abuse detection, different researchers have utilized different evaluation metrics for their experiments – from area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc) BIBREF79 , BIBREF48 to micro and macro F INLINEFORM0 BIBREF28 – regardless of the properties of their datasets. This makes the presented techniques more difficult to compare. In addition, as abuse is a relatively infrequent phenomenon, the datasets are typically skewed towards non-abusive samples BIBREF6 . Metrics such as auroc may, therefore, be unsuitable since they may mask poor performance on the abusive samples as a side-effect of the large number of non-abusive samples BIBREF52 . Macro-averaged precision, recall, and F INLINEFORM1 , as well as precision, recall, and F INLINEFORM2 on specifically the abusive classes, may provide a more informative evaluation strategy; the primary advantage being that macro-averaged metrics provide a sense of effectiveness on the minority classes BIBREF73 . Additionally, area under the precision-recall curve (auprc) might be a better alternative to auroc in imbalanced scenarios BIBREF46 . ", "With the advent of social media, anti-social and abusive behavior has become a prominent occurrence online. Undesirable psychological effects of abuse on individuals make it an important societal problem of our time. Munro munro2011 studied the ill-effects of online abuse on children, concluding that children may develop depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems as a result of their encounters online. Pew Research Center, in its latest report on online harassment BIBREF0 , revealed that INLINEFORM0 of adults in the United States have experienced abusive behavior online, of which INLINEFORM1 have faced severe forms of harassment, e.g., that of sexual nature. The report goes on to say that harassment need not be experienced first-hand to have an impact: INLINEFORM2 of American Internet users admitted that they stopped using an online service after witnessing abusive and unruly behavior of their fellow users. These statistics stress the need for automated abuse detection and moderation systems. Therefore, in the recent years, a new research effort on abuse detection has sprung up in the field of NLP."], "predicted_answer": "any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group"}

Metric 1 is the original metric, weighted cosine similarity (the metric used to evaluate the final version of the results, where we were ranked 5th; metric provided on the task website). This was then changed after the evaluation deadline to equation EQREF25 (which we term metric 2; this is what the first version of the results were actually based on, where we were ranked 4th), which then changed by the organisers to their equation as presented in BIBREF18 (which we term metric 3 and what the second version of the results were based on, where we were ranked 5th).", "As you can see from the results table TABREF28 , the difference between the metrics is quite substantial. This is due to the system's optimisation being based on metric 1 rather than 2. Metric 2 is a classification metric for sentences with one aspect as it penalises values that are of opposite sign (giving -1 score) and rewards values with the same sign (giving +1 score). Our systems are not optimised for this because it would predict scores of -0.01 and true value of 0.01 as very close (within vector of other results) with low error whereas metric 2 would give this the highest error rating of -1 as they are not the same sign. Metric 3 is more similar to metric 1 as shown by the results, however the crucial difference is that again if you get opposite signs it will penalise more. We analysed the top 50 errors based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the test dataset specifically to examine the number of sentences containing more than one aspect. Our investigation shows that no one system is better at predicting the sentiment of sentences that have more than one aspect (i.e. company) within them. Within those top 50 errors we found that the BLSTM systems do not know which parts of the sentence are associated to the company the sentiment is with respect to. Also they do not know the strength/existence of certain sentiment words.", "We first present our findings on the best performing parameters and features for the SVRs. These were determined by cross validation (CV) scores on the provided training data set using cosine similarity as the evaluation metric. We found that using uni-grams and bi-grams performs best and using only bi-grams to be the worst. Using the Unitok tokeniser always performed better than simple whitespace tokenisation. The binary presence of tokens over frequency did not alter performance. The C parameter was tested for three values; 0.01, 0.1 and 1. We found very little difference between 0.1 and 1, but 0.01 produced much poorer results. The eplison parameter was tested for 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 the performance did not differ much but the lower the higher the performance but the more likely to overfit.

In the preceding sections we focused on the standard BLI evaluation, which given our objective is somewhat unfair to the models—they are additionally punished for not capturing lexical semantics. To gain more direct insight into the models' generalization abilities we develop a novel experiment in which the lexeme is controlled for. At test time, the BLI model is given a set of candidate translations, all of which belong to the same paradigm, and is asked to select the most suitable form. Note that the model only requires morphological knowledge to successfully complete the task—no lexical semantics is required.

Two directions of work that try to solve these tasks are: purely data-oriented and purely knowledge-oriented approaches. The data-oriented approaches generally propose to pre-train language models on large linguistic corpora, such that the model would implicitly acquire “commonsense” through its statistical observations. Indeed, large pre-trained language models have achieved promising performance on many commonsense reasoning benchmarks BIBREF29, BIBREF30, BIBREF31, BIBREF32. The main downsides of this approach are that models are difficult to interpret and that they lack mechanisms for incorporating explicit commonsense knowledge. Conversely, purely knowledge-oriented approaches combine structured knowledge bases and perform symbolic reasoning, on the basis of axiomatic principles. Such models enjoy the property of interpretability, but often lack the ability to estimate the statistical salience of an inference, based on real-world observations. Hybrid models are those that attempt to fuse these two approaches, by extracting knowledge from structured knowledge bases and using the resulting information to guide the learning paradigm of statistical estimators, such as deep neural network models.", "To better understand when a model performs better or worse with knowledge-injection, we analyzed model predictions by question type.

The subtle differences across the various knowledge types have been discussed at length in AI by philosophers, computational linguists, and cognitive psychologists BIBREF39. At the high level, we can identify declarative commonsense, whose scope encompasses factual knowledge, e.g., `the sky is blue' and `Paris is in France'; taxonomic knowledge, e.g., `football players are athletes' and `cats are mammals'; relational knowledge, e.g., `the nose is part of the skull' and `handwriting requires a hand and a writing instrument'; procedural commonsense, which includes prescriptive knowledge, e.g., `one needs an oven before baking cakes' and `the electricity should be off while the switch is being repaired' BIBREF40; sentiment knowledge, e.g., `rushing to the hospital makes people worried' and `being in vacation makes people relaxed'; and metaphorical knowledge which includes idiomatic structures, e.g., `time flies' and `raining cats and dogs'.

In autonomous driving, a scene is defined as an observable volume of time and space BIBREF15. On the road, a vehicle may encounter many different situations|such as merging onto a divided highway, stopping at a traffic light, and overtaking another vehicle|all of which are considered as common driving scenes. A scene encapsulates all relevant information about a particular situation, including data from vehicular sensors, objects, events, time and location. A scene can also be divided into a sequence of sub-scenes. As an example, a 20-second drive consisting primarily of the vehicle merging into a highway could be considered as a scene. In addition, all the different situations the vehicle encounters within these 20 seconds can also be represented as (sub-)scenes. In this case, a scene may be associated with a time interval and spatial region while a sub-scene may be associated with a specific timestamp and a set of spatial coordinates. This semantic representation of a scene is formally defined in the Scene Ontology (see figure FIGREF8(a), depicted in Protege). To enable the generation of a KG from the data within NuScenes, the Scene Ontology is extended to include all the concepts (i.e., objects and event categories) found in the NuScenes dataset.", "Recently, there has been a significant increase in the investment for autonomous driving (AD) research and development, with the goal of achieving full autonomy in the next few years. Realizing this vision requires robust ML/AI algorithms that are trained on massive amounts of data. Thousands of cars, equipped with various types of sensors (e.g., LIDAR, RGB, RADAR), are now deployed around the world to collect this heterogeneous data from real-world driving scenes. The primary objective for AD is to use these data to optimize the vehicle's perception pipeline on such tasks as: 3D object detection, obstacle tracking, object trajectory forecasting, and learning an ideal driving policy. Fundamental to all of these tasks will be the vehicle's context understanding capability, which requires knowledge of the time, location, detected objects, participating events, weather, and various other aspects of a driving scene. Even though state-of-the-art AI technologies are used for this purpose, their current effectiveness and scalability are insufficient to achieve full autonomy. Humans naturally exhibit context understanding behind the wheel, where the decisions we make are the result of a continuous evaluation of perceptual cues combined with background knowledge. For instance, human drivers generally know which area of a neighborhood might have icy road conditions on a frigid winter day, where flooding is more frequent after a heavy rainfall, which streets are more likely to have kids playing after school, and which intersections have poor lighting. Currently, this type of common knowledge is not being used to assist self-driving cars and, due to the sample-inefficiency of current ML/AI algorithms, vehicle models cannot effectively learn these phenomena through statistical observation alone. On March 18, 2018, Elaine Herzberg’s death was reported as the first fatality incurred from a collision with an autonomous vehicle. An investigation into the collision, conducted by The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), remarks on the shortcomings of current AD and context understanding technologies. Specifically, NTSB found that the autonomous vehicle incorrectly classified Herzberg as an unknown object, a vehicle, and then a bicycle within the complex scene as she walked across the road. Further investigation revealed that the system design did not include consideration for pedestrians walking outside of a crosswalk, or jaywalking BIBREF9. Simply put, the current AD technology lacks fundamental understanding of the characteristics of objects and events within common scenes; this suggests that more research is required in order to achieve the vision of autonomous driving."], "predicted_answer": "integrating visual cues with a model"}

Those that fit the linear model the best, correspond to a kind of 'core-Twitter' vocabulary, which has a lot in common with the most common words of the English language, but also shows some Twitter-specific elements. A visible group of words that are amongst the most super- or sublinearly scaling words are related to the abundance or lack of the elements of urban lifestyle (e.g. deer, fitness). Thus, the imprint of the physical environment appears in a quantifiable way in the growths of word occurrences as a function of urban populations. Swearwords and slang, that are quite prevalent in this type of corpus BIBREF7 , BIBREF6 , appear at both ends of the regime that suggests that some specific forms of swearing disappear with urbanization, but the share of overall swearing on Twitter grows with city size. The peak consisting of Spanish words at the superlinear end of the exponent distribution marks the stronger presence of the biggest non-English speaking ethnicity in bigger urban areas. This is confirmed by fitting the scaling relationship to the Hispanic or Latino population BIBREF53 of the MSA areas ( INLINEFORM0 , see SI), which despite the large error, is very superlinear.", "In this paper, we investigated the scaling relations in citywise Twitter corpora coming from the Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statstical Areas of the United States. We could observe a slightly superlinear scaling decreasing with the city population for the total volume of the tweets and words created in a city. When observing the scaling of individual words, we found that a certain core vocabulary follows the scaling relationship of that of the bulk text, but most words are sensitive to city size, and their frequencies either increase at a higher or a lower rate with city size than that of the total word volume. At both ends of the spectrum, the meaning of the most superlinearly or most sublinearly scaling words is representative of their exponent. We also examined the increase in the number of words with city size, which has an exponent in the sublinear range. This shows that there is a decreasing amount of new words introduced in larger Twitter corpora."], "predicted_answer": "yes"}

For instance, the GCE model BIBREF9 addresses time complexity within the same architectural framework used by of GLAD BIBREF8, although the latency prediction of the model is still quite poor, at least for a production system (more details in Section SECREF5). This limitation could be attributed to the fact that both GLAD and GCE use separate recurrent modules to output representations for user utterance, system action and slot-value pairs.

Each participant posting at least one message during this period is modeled by a vertex in the produced conversational graph. A mobile window is slid over the whole period, one message at a time.

This is a little bit surprising: we were expecting to get superior results from the Early Fusion, which has direct access to a much larger number of raw features (488). By comparison, the Late Fusion only gets 2 features, which are themselves the outputs of two other classifiers. This means that the Content-Based and Graph-Based classifiers do a good work in summarizing their inputs, without loosing much of the information necessary to efficiently perform the classification task. Moreover, we assume that the Early Fusion classifier struggles to estimate an appropriate model when dealing with such a large number of features, whereas the Late Fusion one benefits from the pre-processing performed by its two predecessors, which act as if reducing the dimensionality of the data. This seems to be confirmed by the results of the Hybrid Fusion, which produces better results than the Early Fusion, but is still below the Late Fusion. This point could be explored by switching to classification algorithm less sensitive to the number of features. Alternatively, when considering the three SVMs used for the Late Fusion, one could see a simpler form of a very basic Multilayer Perceptron, in which each neuron has been trained separately (without system-wide backpropagation). This could indicate that using a regular Multilayer Perceptron directly on the raw features could lead to improved results, especially if enough training data is available.", "Our first observation is that we get higher INLINEFORM0 -measure values compared to both baselines when performing the fusion, independently from the fusion strategy.

Moreover, this shows that both sources are at least partly complementary, since the performance increases when merging them. On a side note, the correlation between the score of the graph- and content-based classifiers is 0.56, which is consistent with these observations.", "Regarding runtime, the graph-based approach takes more than 8 hours to run for the whole corpus, mainly because of the feature computation step.
