We first define on-task intents for the datasets, which are key actions in the task. Since our AntiScam focuses on understanding and reacting towards elicitations, we define elicitation, providing_information and refusal as on-task intents. In the PersuasionForGood dataset, we define nine on-task intents in Table TABREF2 based on the original PersuasionForGood dialog act annotation scheme. All these intents are related to donation actions, which are salient on-task intents in the persuasion task. The off-task intents are the same for both tasks, including six general intents and six additional social intents. General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).", "To better understand user utterances and separate on-task and off-task content within a conversation, previous work has designed hierarchical annotation schemes for specific domains.

BIBREF11 gupta2018semantic used a hierarchical annotation scheme for semantic parsing. Inspired by these studies, our idea is to annotate the intent and semantic slot separately in non-collaborative tasks.

We first separate on-task and off-task intents. As on-task intents are key actions that can vary among different tasks, we need to specifically define on-task intents for each task. On the other hand, since off-task content is too general to design task-specific intents, we choose common dialog acts as the categories. The advantage of this hierarchical annotation scheme is apparent when starting a new non-collaborative task: we only need to focus on designing the on-task categories and semantic slots which are the same as traditional task-oriented dialog systems.

Embedding's dimensionality impacts on the performances supporting the findings in BIBREF14 , but it seems that the quantity (and variety) of data used to generate the embeddings can have a mitigating effect, as shown by the results of the DH-FBK-100 configuration (especially in the classification subtask, and in the Recall scores for the event extent subtask). Coverage of the embeddings (and consequenlty, tokenization of the dataset and the embeddings) is a further aspect to keep into account, but it seems to have a minor impact with respect to dimensionality. It turns out that BIBREF15 's embeddings are those suffering the most from out of vocabulary (OVV) tokens (2.14% and 1.06% in training, 2.77% and 1.84% in test for the word2vec model and GloVe, respectively) with respect to the others. However, they still outperform DH-FBK_100 and ILC-ItWack, whose OVV are much lower (0.73% in training and 1.12% in test for DH-FBK_100; 0.74% in training and 0.83% in test for ILC-ItWack)."], "predicted_answer": "results of the Bi-LSTM-CRF network are varied in both evaluation configurations"}

Unlike word embeddings, the pre-trained language models possess a large number of parameters compared to the task-specific models we build on top them.

As expected, it has been possible to observe that the average time between the dispatch of online reports and the insertion into RNF is sensibly shorter with respect to the insertion from printed reports. Notwithstanding, there is an operation which still requires the manual intervention of responsibles for pharmacovigilance also for online report revisions: the encoding in MedDRA terminology of the free text, through which the reporter describes one or more adverse drug reactions. MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) is a medical terminology introduced with the purpose to standardize and facilitate the sharing of information about medicinal products in particular with respect to regulatory activities BIBREF5 . The description of a suspected ADR through narrative text could seem redundant/useless. Indeed, one could reasonably imagine sound solutions based either on an autocompletion form or on a menu with MedDRA terms. In these solutions, the description of ADRs would be directly encoded by the reporter and no expert work for MedDRA terminology extraction would be required. However, such solutions are not completely suited for the pharmacovigilance domain and the narrative description of ADRs remains a desirable feature, for at least two reasons. First, the description of an ADR by means of one of the seventy thousand MedDRA terms is a complex task. In most cases, the reporter who points out the adverse reaction is not an expert in MedDRA terminology. This holds in particular for citizens, but it is still valid for several professionals. Thus, describing ADRs by means of natural language sentences is simpler. Second, the choice of the suitable term(s) from a given list or from an autocompletion field can influence the reporter and limit her/his expressiveness. As a consequence, the quality of the description would be also in this case undermined. Therefore, VigiFarmaco offers a free-text field for specifying the ADR with all the possible details, without any restriction about the content or strict limits to the length of the written text. Consequently, MedDRA encoding has then to be manually implemented by qualified people responsible for pharmacovigilance, before the transmission to RNF.

It is worth noting that this test simply estimates how much, for each report, the MagiCoder behavior is similar to the manual work, without considering the effective quality of the manual encoding. Clearly, as a set of official reports, revised and sent to RNF, we assume to deal with an high-quality encoding: notwithstanding, some errors in the human encoding possibly occur. Moreover, the query we perform to compare manual and automatic encoding is, obviously, quantitative.

Thus, an LLT INLINEFORM0 returned by MagiCoder that has not been selected by the expert because redundant is not truly a false positive.

First, we looked at how editors tag news articles. Figure illustrates the difference between the annotation behaviour of readers, authors and editors through the number of times that each unique keyphrase is used in the gold standard. We see that non-expert annotators use a larger, less controlled indexing vocabulary, in part because they lack the higher level of domain expertise that editors have. For example, we observe that frequent keyphrases in KPTimes are close to topic descriptors (e.g. “Baseball“, “Politics and Government“) while those appearing only once are very precise (e.g. “Marley's Cafe“, “Catherine E. Connelly“). Annotations in KPTimes are arguably more uniform and consistent, through the use of tag suggestions, which, as we will soon discuss in §SECREF12, makes it easier for supervised approaches to learn a good model.", "Thus, unlike author annotations, those produced by readers exhibit significantly lower missing keyphrases, that is, gold keyphrases that do not occur in the content of the document. In the DUC-2001 dataset for example, more than 96% of the gold keyphrases actually appear in the documents. This confirms previous observations that readers tend to assign keyphrases in an extractive fashion BIBREF12, which makes these datasets less suitable for the task at hand (keyphrase generation) but rather relevant for a purely extractive task (keyphrase extraction). Yet, author-assigned keyphrases commonly found in scientific paper datasets are not perfect either, as they are less constrained BIBREF13 and include seldom-used variants or misspellings that negatively impact performance. One can see there is an apparent lack of sizeable expert-annotated data that enables the development of neural keyphrase generation models in a domain other than scholarly texts. Here, we fill this gap and propose a large-scale dataset that includes news texts paired with manually curated gold standard annotations.", "Frequently used datasets for keyphrase generation have a common characteristic that they are, by and large, made from scholarly documents (abstracts or full texts) paired with non-expert (mostly from authors) annotations. Notable examples of such datasets are SemEval-2010 BIBREF8 and KP20k BIBREF2, which respectively comprises scientific articles and paper abstracts, both about computer science and information technology. Detailed statistics are listed in Table . Only two publicly available datasets, that we are aware of, contain news documents: DUC-2001 BIBREF9 and KPCrowd BIBREF10.

BIBREF0 propose that “prior information regarding morphology ... among others, should be incorporated” into character-level models, while BIBREF6 counter that it is “unnecessary to consider these prior information” when modeling characters. Whether we need to explicitly model morphology is a question whose answer has a real cost: as ballesteros-dyer-smith:2015:EMNLP note, morphological annotation is expensive, and this expense could be reinvested elsewhere if the predictive aspects of morphology are learnable from strings.", "Do character-level models learn morphology? We view this as an empirical claim requiring empirical evidence. The claim has been tested implicitly by comparing character-level models to word lookup models BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 .

Since the nominative, accusative, and dative morphological cases are strongly (though not perfectly) correlated with these dependencies, it is easy to see why the morphologically-aware oracle is able to predict them so well. We hypothesized that these cases are more challenging for the character model because these languages feature a high degree of syncretism—functionally distinct words that have the same form—and in particular case syncretism. For example, referring back to examples ( UID28 ) and ( UID28 ), the character model must disambiguate pisˊmo from its context, whereas the oracle can directly disambiguate it from a feature of the word itself.", "While our results show that prior knowledge of morphology is important, they also show that it can be used in a targeted way: our character-level models improved markedly when we augmented them only with case. This suggests a pragmatic reality in the middle of the wide spectrum between pure machine learning from raw text input and linguistically-intensive modeling: our new models don't need all prior linguistic knowledge, but they clearly benefit from some knowledge in addition to raw input. While we used a data-driven analysis to identify case syncretism as a problem for neural parsers, this result is consistent with previous linguistically-informed analyses BIBREF20 , BIBREF19 .

Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 .", "The goal of discourse analysis in our method is the segmentation of the text for the basic units of discourse structures EDU (Elementary Discourse Units) and connecting them to determine semantic relations.

At this stage, existing discourse parsers will model the structure and the labels of a DT separately. They do not take into account the sequential dependencies between the DT constituents. Then existing discourse parsers will apply greedy and sub-optimal parsing algorithms and build a Discourse Tree. During this stage, and to cope with the mentioned limitation The inferred (posterior) probabilities can be used from CRF parsing models in a probabilistic CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm BIBREF14 which is non-greedy and optimal. Finally, discourse parsers do not discriminate between intra-sentential parsing (i.e., building the DTs for individual sentences) and multi-sentential parsing (i.e., building a DT for the whole document) BIBREF0 .

See BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 for details on how the scores are computed and averaged over speakers and phonemes to obtain the final ABX error rate. One usually distinguishes between the within-speaker error rate where all three triplets belong to the same speaker, and the cross-speaker error rate where INLINEFORM5 and INLINEFORM6 are from the same and INLINEFORM7 from a different speaker.", "The ABX evaluation includes all such minimal pair phoneme triplets of the evaluation corpus. These pairs therefore rarely correspond to full words, making it a somewhat abstract task whose results may be difficult to interpret when summarizing it as a single final metric. ABX can however be very suitable for more fine-grained analysis of speech phenomena by including only specific phonetic contrasts in the evaluation BIBREF41 . In contrast, the same-different task always compares whole words and directly evaluates how good feature representations are at telling whether two utterances are the same word or not. Thus it has an immediate link to applications like spoken term detection and it allows easier error analysis. It is also faster to prepare the same-different evaluation set and run the evaluation. We wish to verify that the ABX and same-different measures correlate well, to better compare studies that use only one of them and to allow choosing the task that is more appropriate for the situation at hand."], "predicted_answer": "same-different measures"}

Furthermore, since the root of the problem is local normalization, our view is that these modifications should be trained as globally-normalized models (Section SECREF6 ).", "Another way to demonstrate that the beam problem is the same as the brevity problem is to look at the translations generated by baseline systems on shorter sentences. Figure FIGREF18 shows the BLEU scores of the Russian–English system for beams of size 10 and 1000 on sentences of varying lengths, with and without correcting lengths. The x-axes of the figure are cumulative: length 20 includes sentences of length 0–20, while length 10 includes 0–10. It is worth noting that BLEU is a word-level metric, but the systems were built using BPE; so the sequences actually generated are longer than the x-axes would suggest.", "Here, we first show that the beam problem is indeed the brevity problem.

Each table looks at the impact on BLEU, METEOR, and the ratio of the lengths of generated sentences compared to the gold lengths BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 .

However, in neural machine translation, increasing the beam size has been shown to degrade performance. This is the last of the six challenges identified by BIBREF0 .", "As in our label-bias example, greedy search would prune the incorrect empty translation. More generally, consider beam search: at time step INLINEFORM0 , only the top INLINEFORM1 partial or complete translations are retained while the rest are pruned. (Implementations of beam search vary in the details, but this variant is simplest for the sake of argument.) Even if a translation ending at time INLINEFORM2 scores higher than a longer translation, as long as it does not fall within the top INLINEFORM3 when compared with partial translations of length INLINEFORM4 (or complete translations of length at most INLINEFORM5 ), it will be pruned and unable to block the longer translation. But if we widen the beam ( INLINEFORM6 ), then translation accuracy will suffer. We call this problem (which is BIBREF0 's sixth challenge) the beam problem.

As an upper bound, we also included Gold standard summaries. The study was conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS; BIBREF42), a less labor-intensive alternative to paired comparisons that has been shown to produce more reliable results than rating scales BIBREF43. Specifically, participants were shown the movie title and basic background information (i.e., synopsis, release year, genre, director, and cast). They were also presented with three system summaries and asked to select the best and worst among them according to Informativeness (i.e., does the summary convey opinions about specific aspects of the movie in a concise manner?), Correctness (i.e., is the information in the summary factually accurate and does it correspond to the information given about the movie?), and Grammaticality (i.e., is the summary fluent and grammatical?). Examples of system summaries are shown in Figure FIGREF1 and Figure FIGREF37. We randomly selected 50 movies from the test set and compared all possible combinations of summary triples for each movie. We collected three judgments for each comparison. The order of summaries and movies was randomized per participant.

Similar to EA-based systems, the latter biases summary generation towards the $k$ most salient extracted opinions using an additional extractive module, which may not contain information relevant to the user's need (we set $k=5$ in our experiments).

The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Mulić BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7.

However, the fact that they referred to them in a text published in 1959 (probably prepared for publishing in 1958, based on BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrović described that the group had started its work in 1958) leads us to the conclusion that the poorly funded Croatian research was lagging only a couple of years behind the research of the superpowers (which invested heavily in this effort). Another interesting moment, which they delineated in BIBREF11, is that the group soon discovered that some experimental work had already been done in 1957 at the Institute of Telecommunications (today a part of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing at the University of Zagreb) by Vladimir Matković.

This was based on previous calculations of language entropy by Matković, and Matković's idea was simple: conduct a statistical analysis to determine the most frequent letters and assign them the shortest binary code. So A would get 101, while F would get 11010011 BIBREF11. Building on that, Laszlo suggested that, when making an efficient machine translation system, one has to take into account not just the letter frequencies but also the redundancies of some of the letters in a word BIBREF16. This suggests that the strategy would be as follows: first make a thesaurus, and pick a representative for each meaning, then stem or lemmatize the words, then remove the needless letters from words (i.e. letters that carry little information, such as vowels, but being careful not to equate two different words), and then encode the words in binary strings, using the letter frequencies. After that, the texts are ready for translation, but unfortunately, the translation method is never explicated. Nevertheless, it is hinted that it should be \"cybernetic\", which, along with what we have presented earlier, would most probably mean artificial neural networks. This is highlighted by the following passage (BIBREF11, p. 117):", "In modern times, the idea of machine translation was put forth by the philosopher and logician Yehoshua Bar-Hillel (most notably in BIBREF1 and BIBREF2), whose papers were studied by the Croatian group. Perhaps the most important unrealized point of contact between machine translation and cybernetics happened in the winter of 1950/51. In that period, Bar-Hillel met Rudolf Carnap in Chicago, who introduced to him the (new) idea of cybernetics. Also, Carnap gave him the contact details of his former teaching assistant, Walter Pitts, who was at that moment with Norbert Wiener at MIT and who was supposed to introduce him to Wiener, but the meeting never took place BIBREF3. Nevertheless, Bar-Hillel was to stay at MIT where he, inspired by cybernetics, would go to organize the first machine translation conference in the world in 1952 BIBREF3."], "predicted_answer": "artificial neural networks"}

The modelling would be statistical, but its purpose would not be to mimic the stochasticity of the human thought process, but rather to produce a working machine translation system. Kulagina and Melchuk disagreed with this approach as they thought that more of what is presently called \"philosophical logic\" was needed to model the human thought process at the symbolic level, and according to them, the formalization of the human thought process was a prerequisite for developing a machine translation system (cf. BIBREF6). We could speculate that sub-symbolic processing would have been acceptable too, since that approach is also rooted in philosophical logic as a way of formalizing human cognitive functions and is also \"internal\" in the same sense symbolic approaches are.", "In the USSR, there were four major approaches to machine translation in the late 1950s BIBREF7. The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Mulić BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin. Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Mathematical Linguistics Seminar at the Faculty of Philology in Moscow in 1956 and in Leningrad in 1957. Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time. This was the main role model for the Croatian efforts from 1957 onwards. The fourth, and perhaps most influential, was the approach at the Experimental Laboratory of the Leningrad University championed by N. D. Andreev BIBREF7. Here, the algorithms for Indonesian-Russian, Arabic-Russian, Hindu-Russian, Japanese-Russian, Burmese-Russian, Norwegian-Russian, English-Russian, Spanish-Russian and Turkish-Russian were being built. The main approach of Andreev's group was to use an intermediary language, which would capture the meanings BIBREF7. It was an approach similar to KL-ONE, which would be introduced in the West much later (in 1985) by Brachman and Schmolze BIBREF8. It is also interesting to note that the Andreev group had a profound influence on the Czechoslovakian machine translation program BIBREF9, which unfortunately suffered a similar fate as the Yugoslav one due to the lack of funding.", "Laszlo and Petrović BIBREF11 considered cybernetics (as described in BIBREF13 by Wiener, who invented the term “cybernetics”) to be the best approach for machine translation in the long run.

A better approach, which was not beyond the thinking of the group since it was already proposed by Matković in his dissertation from 1957 BIBREF20, would be to use word bigrams and align them. It is worth mentioning that, although the idea of machine translation in the 1950s in Croatia did not have a significant influence on development of the field, it shows that Croatian linguists had contemporary views and necessary competencies for its development. But, unfortunately, the development of machine translation in Croatia had been stopped because of the previously discussed circumstances. In 1964, Laszlo went to the USA, where he spent the next seven years, and after returning to Croatia, he was active as a university professor, but because of disagreement with the ruling political option regarding Croatian language issues, he published very rarely and was mainly focused on other linguistic issues in that period, but his work was a major influence on the later development of computational linguistics in Croatia.", "The Russian machine translation pioneer Andreev expressed hope that the Yugoslav (Croatian) research group could create a prototype, but sadly, due to the lack of federal funding, this never happened BIBREF10.

We then select the top scoring grams to be used as features for the language model. N-grams and words frequency have been used in the literature to classify similar problems, such as hate-speech and extremist text and have proven successful BIBREF16 . The second method we use is word embeddings to capture semantic meanings. Research in NLP has compared the effectiveness of word embedding methods for encoding semantic meaning and found that semantic relationships between words are best captured by word vectors within word embedding models BIBREF17 . Therefore, we train word2vec model on our propaganda corpus to build the lexical semantic aspects of the text using vector space models. We learn word embeddings using skip-gram word2vec model implemented in the gensim package with vector size of 100 and window size of 5. This word embedding model is used to obtain the vector representation for each word. We aggregate the vectors for each word in the tweet, and concatenate the maximum and average for each word vector dimension, such that any given tweet is represented in 200 dimension sized vector. This approach of aggregating vectors was used successfully in previous research BIBREF18 .

Torok BIBREF12 used a grounded theory approach to develop an explanatory model for the radicalization process utilizing concepts of psychiatric power. Their findings show that the process typically starts with the social isolation of individuals. This isolation seems to be self-imposed as individuals tend to spend a long time engaging with radical content. This leads to the concept of homophily, the tendency to interact and associate with similar others. Through constant interaction with like-minded people, an individual gradually strengthens their mindset and progresses to more extreme levels. Similarly, they start to feel as being part of a group with a strong group identity which leads to group polarization. In psychology, group polarization occurs when discussion leads the group to adopt actions that are more extreme than the initial actions of the individual group members BIBREF13 . Moreover, the National Police Service Agency of the Netherlands developed a model to describe the phases a Jihadist may pass through before committing an act of terrorism BIBREF14 .

A more complete multi-turn evaluation is typically measured with a Likert scale (usually 1-4 or 1-5) after the conversation takes place.

Regarding a comparison of the data selection methods, Moore-Lewis performed better than Domain-Cosine, while Domain-Finetune performed best, showing the benefit of fine-tuning large pretrained models for the data selection task.

For example, note how in the results for the Medical domain-specific model (first row in Table TABREF28), the BLEU scores on the Law and IT test sets are much higher in comparison to those on the Koran and Subtitles test sets, which clusters are farther away in the visualized embedding space. Similarly, as the Subtitles cluster (Blue) is closer to the Koran cluster (Green), the highest cross-domain BLEU score on the Koran test set is from the Subtitles model. To further quantify this phenomenon, we plot and measure Pearson's correlation between the cosine similarity of the centroids for the English BERT-based dev sentence representations for each domain pair, and the cross-domain BLEU score for this domain pair. This is shown in Figure FIGREF29. We can see the general trend where the closer the domain centroids are (with a similarity of 1 for training and evaluating on the same domain), the higher the cross-domain BLEU is between those domains, resulting in a Pearson's correlation of 0.81 (strong correlation). This suggests that such preliminary visual analysis can be a useful tool for understanding the relationship between diverse datasets, and motivates the use of pre-trained language model representations for domain data selection in MT.", "We perform an analysis on the selected datasets, where we measure the precision and recall of sentence selection with respect to the oracle selection.

In this section we focus on a data-selection scenario where only a very small number of in-domain sentences are used to select data from a larger unlabeled parallel corpus. An established method for data selection was proposed by BIBREF4, which was also used in training the winning systems in WMT 2019 BIBREF39, BIBREF40.

A common definition treats a domain as a data source: “a domain is defined by a corpus from a specific source, and may differ from other domains in topic, genre, style, level of formality, etc.” BIBREF8. We claim that a more data-driven definition should take place, as different data sources may have sentences with similar traits and vice versa - a single massive web-crawled corpus contains texts in numerous styles, topics and registers. Our analysis in Section SECREF2 shows examples for such cases, e.g. a sentence discussing “Viruses and virus-like organisms” in a legal corpus.", "As can be seen in Figure FIGREF15, in some areas the domains are somewhat overlapping in the embedding space, which may lead to outlier cases where examples from one domain are assigned to a cluster of a another domain.

We first note that the outlier sentences are much shorter than the average sentence length in the corpus (11.62 tokens on average for outliers vs. 20.5 tokens on average in general). This makes sense as shorter sentences contain less information, making it harder to assign them to an appropriate cluster. Table TABREF19 shows examples of outlier sentences, assigned to clusters of domains different from their originating domain. We can see that in many cases the assignments are sensible – for example for sentences originating from the subtitles corpus, a sentence that mentions “great priest” is assigned to the Koran cluster, a sentence that mentions “The International Criminal Court in The Hague” is assigned to the Law cluster, a sentence that mentions “the virus” is assigned to the Medical cluster and so on.

Figure FIGREF7 provides an illustration of the proposed approach.", "The first block shows the two baseline models providing reference performance. The AttnCopy-S2S model only concerns about content fidelity, and achieves a high content precision score (but a low recall). However, its style BLEU is particularly low, which verifies the rich variation in language and that direct supervised learning is incapable of controlling the variation. We can see that the rule-based method achieves reasonably good precision and recall, setting a strong baseline for content fidelity. As discussed above, the rule-based method can reach the maximum BLEU (100) after masking out content tokens. To improve over the strong rule-based baseline, we would expect a method that provides significantly higher precision/recall, while keeping a high BLEU score. The two style transfer methods (MAST and AdvST) fail the expectation, as their content fidelity performance is greatly inferior or merely comparable to the rule-based method. This is partially because these models are built on a different task assumption (i.e., modifying independent textual attributes) and cannot manipulate content well. In comparison, our proposed model achieves better content precision/recall, substantially improving over other methods (e.g., with a 15-point precision boost in comparison with the rule-based baseline) except for AttnCopy-S2S which has failed in style control. Our method also manages to preserve a high BLEU score of over 80. The superior performance of the full model compared to the variant Ours-w/o-Coverage demonstrates the usefulness of the content coverage constraint (Eq. EQREF15 ).

Consequently, annotators for languages other than English are faced with a noisier (and potentially harder) task.

While humans tend to give similar scores for each violation type, models tend to assign higher log probability scores to sentences with doubled nominatives than to grammatical sentences, leading to worse than chance performance on Nominative violations. Conversely, models tend to assign lower log probability scores to sentences with doubled datives, likely because these sentences lack either a nominative or an accusative, both of which are more frequent than dative. This leads to better than human performance on this case violation. Such behavior is probably due to the fact that German being a non pro-drop language, every verb must have a nominative case, making nominative more frequent than accusative, and that dative even rarer. This frequency bias is worse for models that are directly based on frequency, such as our unigram and bigram models.

In particular, are representations derived through language modeling able to effectively encode syntactic structures and relations? Do they encode them in a reliable and systematic way?", "We set up a well controlled grammaticality test for the processing of argument structure in neural language models and in humans. The results show that LSTMs are better than chance in detecting an abnormal argument structure, despite the fact that the arguments could occur in any position, due to the generally free word order of phrases in German relative clauses. The average performance of models, though, is far from 100% correct and lower than humans, and the error patterns differ markedly. Contrary to humans, neural language models are overly sensitive to frequency distribution of phrase types. For instance, they assign a higher probability to sentences containing multiple nominative phrases than a correct sentence with only one nominative phrase. This frequency bias directly reflects the frequency of nominative, accusative and dative in the language, as the same bias is found in unigram and bigram models. Similar to the conclusion reached by BIBREF21 in their investigation of the error patterns made by RNNs and humans on syntactic agreement, we find that the syntactic representations of humans and LSTMs differ in some respects.", "Surprisingly, humans performed only slightly better than the LSTM.

We also notice that AUC varies relatively little across different templates for our models, indicating that the particular choice of template has little impact. For humans, the wider spread in results can be attributed partially to the fact that 55 random permutations out of the 144 permutations were annotated for each template.

Each memory cell in $M_{cel}$ represents the embedding of a table cell. Each cell in $M_{row}$ represent the vector a row, which is computed with weighted average over the embeddings of cells in the same row. We derive the column memory $M_{col}$ in an analogous way.

Following such approaches, there has been a number of techniques aimed at generating adversarial examples BIBREF2, BIBREF3. Depending on the degree of access to the target model, an adversary may operate in one of the two different settings: (a) black-box setting, where an adversary doesn't have access to target model's internal architecture or its parameters, (b) white-box setting, where an adversary has access to the target model, its parameters, and input feature representations. In both these settings, the adversary cannot alter the training data or the target model itself. Depending on the purpose of the adversary, adversarial attacks can be categorized as (a) targeted attack and (b) non-targeted attack.

Continuous data like image or speech is much more tolerant to perturbations compared to text BIBREF6. In textual domain, even a small perturbation is clearly perceptible and can completely change the semantics of the text. Another challenge for generating adversarial examples relates to identifying salient areas of the text where a perturbation can be applied successfully to fool the target classifier. In addition to fooling the target classifier, the adversary is designed with different constraints depending on the task and its motivations BIBREF7.

We conducted an experiment where the workers were presented with randomly sampled 100 adversarial examples generated by our model which were successful in fooling the target classifier.

For every adversarial example shown, we also showed the original text and asked them to rate their similarity on a scale from 0 (Very Different) to 3 (Very Similar). We found that the perturbations produced by our model do not affect the human judgments significantly as $94.6\\%$ of the human annotations matched with the ground-truth label of the original text.

The results are obtained using pyrouge package. The performance of various models and our improvements are summarized in Table TABREF37. A direct implementation of NSE performed very poorly due to the simple dot-product attention mechanism. In NMT, a transformation from word-vectors in one language to another one (say English to French) using a mere matrix multiplication is enough because of the one-to-one correspondence between words and the underlying linear structure imposed in learning the word vectors BIBREF23. However, in text summarization a word (sentence) could be a condensation of a group of words (sentences). Therefore, using a complex neural network-based attention mechanism proposed improved the performance. Both dot-product and additive BIBREF11 mechanisms perform similarly for the NMT task, but the difference is more pronounced for the text summarization task simply because of the nature of the problem as described earlier. Replacing Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) in the NSE with an LSTM further improved the performance because it remembers what was previously composed and facilitates the composition of novel words. This also eliminates the need for additional mechanisms to penalize repetitions such as coverage BIBREF2 and intra-attention BIBREF18.

Two factors may explain this discrepancy: the Mboshi5k data being different from the training data of the MBN neural network, the neural network may not generalize well. Another possibility may be that the initialization scheme of the model is not suitable for this type of features. Indeed, Variational Bayesian Inference algorithm converges only to a local optimum of the objective function and is therefore dependent of the initialization. We believe the second explanation is the more likely since, as we shall see shortly, the best results in term of word segmentation and NMI are eventually obtained with the MBN features when the inference is done with the informative prior.

The SVAE significantly improves the NMI and the precision showing that it extracts more consistent units than the HMM model. However, it also degrades the segmentation in terms of recall.

Moreover, if human evaluation is performed anyway during a model's development cycle, there is no additional cost associated to using these annotations for further improving the model. In addition to that, it is easy to capture consensus between multiple raters to reduce noise, e.g., by averaging their scores; it is completely non-trivial to achieve a similar effect from multiple ground-truth labels.

The major advantages of this approach are: 1) the fact that there are no hand-crafted rules encoded; 2) the ability to handle misspelled words (because the search engine alleviates that and returns relevant or related information) and incomplete sentences; 3) the generic design of its components, allowing multilingual processing with little effort (the only dependency is the POS tagger) and straightforward extension to support more NER classes (requiring a corpus of images and text associated to each desired NER class, which can be obtained from a Knowledge Base, such as DBpedia, and an image dataset, such as METU dataset). While initial results in a gold standard dataset showed the potential of the approach, we also plan to integrate these outcomes into a Sequence Labeling (SL) system, including neural architectures such as LSTM, which are more suitable for such tasks as NER or POS.

The model achieved a recall of INLINEFORM0 on the flame messages, and INLINEFORM1 on the non-flame ones in the test set.

The authors concluded that important contextual indicators (such as harassment posts generally being off-topic) cannot be captured by local features alone.

Its nature and characteristics constantly evolve, making it a complex phenomenon to study and model. Automated abuse detection methods have seen a lot of development in recent years: from simple rule-based methods aimed at identifying directed, explicit abuse to sophisticated methods that can capture rich semantic information and even aspects of user behavior. By comprehensively reviewing the investigated methods to date, our survey aims to provide a platform for future research, facilitating progress in this important area. While we see an array of challenges that lie ahead, e.g., modeling extra-propositional aspects of language, user behavior and wider conversation, we believe that recent progress in the areas of semantics, dialogue modeling and social media analysis put the research community in a strong position to address them. Summaries of public datasets In table TABREF4 , we summarize the datasets described in this paper that are publicly available and provide links to them. A discussion of metrics The performance results we have reported highlight that, throughout work on abuse detection, different researchers have utilized different evaluation metrics for their experiments – from area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auroc) BIBREF79 , BIBREF48 to micro and macro F INLINEFORM0 BIBREF28 – regardless of the properties of their datasets. This makes the presented techniques more difficult to compare. In addition, as abuse is a relatively infrequent phenomenon, the datasets are typically skewed towards non-abusive samples BIBREF6 . Metrics such as auroc may, therefore, be unsuitable since they may mask poor performance on the abusive samples as a side-effect of the large number of non-abusive samples BIBREF52 . Macro-averaged precision, recall, and F INLINEFORM1 , as well as precision, recall, and F INLINEFORM2 on specifically the abusive classes, may provide a more informative evaluation strategy; the primary advantage being that macro-averaged metrics provide a sense of effectiveness on the minority classes BIBREF73 . Additionally, area under the precision-recall curve (auprc) might be a better alternative to auroc in imbalanced scenarios BIBREF46 . ", "With the advent of social media, anti-social and abusive behavior has become a prominent occurrence online. Undesirable psychological effects of abuse on individuals make it an important societal problem of our time. Munro munro2011 studied the ill-effects of online abuse on children, concluding that children may develop depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems as a result of their encounters online. Pew Research Center, in its latest report on online harassment BIBREF0 , revealed that INLINEFORM0 of adults in the United States have experienced abusive behavior online, of which INLINEFORM1 have faced severe forms of harassment, e.g., that of sexual nature. The report goes on to say that harassment need not be experienced first-hand to have an impact: INLINEFORM2 of American Internet users admitted that they stopped using an online service after witnessing abusive and unruly behavior of their fellow users.

Labeling experiences as abusive provides powerful validation for victims of abuse and enables observers to grasp the scope of the problem.

This points to a critical issue: automated systems embody the morals and values of their creators and annotators BIBREF30 , BIBREF29 . It is therefore imperative that we design systems that overcome such issues. For e.g., some recent works have investigated ways to mitigate gender bias in models BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 .", "Remarks. In their study, Ross et al. ross stressed the difficulty in reliably annotating abuse, which stems from multiple factors, such as the lack of “standard” definitions for the myriad types of abuse, differences in annotators' cultural background and experiences, and ambiguity in the annotation guidelines. That said, Waseem et al. W17-3012 and Nobata et al. nobata observed that annotators with prior expertise provide good-quality annotations with high levels of agreement. We note that most datasets contain discrete labels only; abuse detection systems trained on them would be deprived of the notion of severity, which is vital in real-world settings. Also, most datasets cover few types of abuse only. Salminen et al. salminen2018anatomy suggest fine-grained annotation schemes for deeper understanding of abuse; they propose 29 categories that include both types of abuse and their targets (e.g., humiliation, religion).", "That said, the notion of abuse has proven elusive and difficult to formalize. Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse. This is illustrated in the works of Dadvar et al. davdar and Waseem and Hovy waseemhovy: Dadvar et al. observed an inter-annotator agreement of INLINEFORM0 on their cyber-bullying dataset. Cyber-bullying is a classic example of directed and explicit abuse since there is typically a single target who is harassed with personal attacks. On the other hand, Waseem and Hovy noted that INLINEFORM1 of all the disagreements in annotation of their dataset occurred on the sexism class.

Similar improvements can be seen in ASC results with an increase of +2.16 in MF1 score for restaurant compared to +0.81 for laptop which is due to the increase in the number of training epochs for restaurant domain since it exhibits better results with more training while the model reaches its peak performance for laptop domain in earlier training epochs. In addition, applying adversarial training improves the network's performance in both tasks, though at different rates. While for laptop there are similar improvements in both tasks (+0.69 in AE, +0.61 in ASC), for restaurant we observe different enhancements (+0.81 in AE, +0.12 in ASC).

Allen Newell and Herbert Simon described this sense-making capability in their theory of cognition BIBREF0, BIBREF1: through sensory stimuli, humans accumulate experiences, generalize, and reason over them, storing the resulting knowledge in memory; the dynamic combination of live experience and distilled knowledge during task-execution, enables humans to make time-effective decisions and evaluate how good or bad a decision was by factoring in external feedback.", "Endowing machines with this sense-making capability has been one of the long-standing goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) practice and research, both in industry and academia.

One aspect of this strategy is that each answer-option is encoded independently, which limits the model's ability to find correlations between answer-options and with respect to the original question context. To address this issue, the Option Comparison Network (OCN) BIBREF41 was introduced to explicitly model the pairwise answer-option interactions, making OCN better-suited for multiple-choice QA task structures.

Realizing this vision requires robust ML/AI algorithms that are trained on massive amounts of data. Thousands of cars, equipped with various types of sensors (e.g., LIDAR, RGB, RADAR), are now deployed around the world to collect this heterogeneous data from real-world driving scenes. The primary objective for AD is to use these data to optimize the vehicle's perception pipeline on such tasks as: 3D object detection, obstacle tracking, object trajectory forecasting, and learning an ideal driving policy. Fundamental to all of these tasks will be the vehicle's context understanding capability, which requires knowledge of the time, location, detected objects, participating events, weather, and various other aspects of a driving scene. Even though state-of-the-art AI technologies are used for this purpose, their current effectiveness and scalability are insufficient to achieve full autonomy. Humans naturally exhibit context understanding behind the wheel, where the decisions we make are the result of a continuous evaluation of perceptual cues combined with background knowledge. For instance, human drivers generally know which area of a neighborhood might have icy road conditions on a frigid winter day, where flooding is more frequent after a heavy rainfall, which streets are more likely to have kids playing after school, and which intersections have poor lighting. Currently, this type of common knowledge is not being used to assist self-driving cars and, due to the sample-inefficiency of current ML/AI algorithms, vehicle models cannot effectively learn these phenomena through statistical observation alone. On March 18, 2018, Elaine Herzberg’s death was reported as the first fatality incurred from a collision with an autonomous vehicle. An investigation into the collision, conducted by The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), remarks on the shortcomings of current AD and context understanding technologies. Specifically, NTSB found that the autonomous vehicle incorrectly classified Herzberg as an unknown object, a vehicle, and then a bicycle within the complex scene as she walked across the road. Further investigation revealed that the system design did not include consideration for pedestrians walking outside of a crosswalk, or jaywalking BIBREF9.

Such latency may soon become a serious limitation for their deployment into concrete application scenarios with increasing number of slots, where real time is a strong requirement. Along this perspective, this work investigates the time complexity of state-of-the-art DST models and addresses their current limitations. Our contributions are the following:", "The time complexity for GLAD, GCE and our model (G-SAT) is shown in Figure FIGREF36. All models are executed with batch size of 50, under the same environment and hardware (single GeForce GTX 1080Ti GPU). As the pre-processing and post-processing of each model can vary based on the implementation and the approach, we report only the time complexity for the model execution after it is loaded and ready to be executed. GLAD requires 1.78 seconds for training for each batch of data, and 0.84 seconds to predict for a batch. Since GCE does not require a separate encoder for each slot, as in GLAD, it reduces the training time to 1.16 seconds, and the prediction time to 0.52 seconds. Our approach has a significant advantage in the execution time, requiring only 0.06 seconds for training and 0.03 for prediction of each batch. We notice that, while the time complexity of GLAD and GCE reported in BIBREF9 coincide with our results for training, results on the test data differ considerably. In fact, the time complexity for GCE reported in BIBREF9 was 1.92 seconds, while in our experiment we found that GCE instead processes 1.92 batches/second leading to 0.52 seconds/batch.", "Current DST models use recurrent neural networks (RNN), as they are able to capture temporal dependencies in the input sentence. A RNN processes each token in the input sequentially, one after the other, and so can incur significant latency if not modeled well. Apart from the architecture, the number of slots and values of the domain ontology also affects the time complexity of the DST. Recent works BIBREF6, BIBREF8, BIBREF7 use RNNs to obtain very high performance for DST, but nevertheless are quite limited as far as the efficiency of the models are concerned. For instance, the GCE model BIBREF9 addresses time complexity within the same architectural framework used by of GLAD BIBREF8, although the latency prediction of the model is still quite poor, at least for a production system (more details in Section SECREF5). This limitation could be attributed to the fact that both GLAD and GCE use separate recurrent modules to output representations for user utterance, system action and slot-value pairs. These output representations need then to be combined using a scoring module which scores a given slot-value pair based on the user utterance and the system action separately. In this work, we investigate approaches that overcome the complexity of such architectures and improve the latency time without compromising the DST performance."], "predicted_answer": "our approach"}

Another approach was used by BIBREF12 in autoencoders that learned binary codes for small images. During the forward pass, activations in the coding layer were rounded to 0 or 1. Original (i.e. not rounded) activations were used when backpropagating errors. Alternatively, one could model the document codes with stochastic binary neurons. Learning in this case can still proceed with error backpropagation, provided that a suitable gradient estimator is used alongside stochastic activations.

One solution could be to train the model with a big generic text corpus, that covers a wide variety of domains.

The tracklet set defines $\\mathcal {R}$ of equation (DISPLAY_FORM7).", "We augment an input feature vector with the cosine similarity score between the input and a face signature, which results in a classification function of the form of $\\langle \\mathbf {x},\\mathbf {w}^h_{1:d} \\rangle + w^h_{d+1}\\cos \\big (\\mathbf {x}, \\mathbf {q}_h\\big )-b^h,$ where $\\mathbf {x}\\in {\\mathbb {R}^d}$, $\\mathbf {q}_h$ is $h$'s face signature obtained as the mean of the gallery face features of $h$, $\\text{cos}(\\cdot )$ is the cosine similarity, and $\\big (\\mathbf {w}^h,b^h\\big )$ are linear weights and bias.

This is a little bit surprising: we were expecting to get superior results from the Early Fusion, which has direct access to a much larger number of raw features (488). By comparison, the Late Fusion only gets 2 features, which are themselves the outputs of two other classifiers. This means that the Content-Based and Graph-Based classifiers do a good work in summarizing their inputs, without loosing much of the information necessary to efficiently perform the classification task. Moreover, we assume that the Early Fusion classifier struggles to estimate an appropriate model when dealing with such a large number of features, whereas the Late Fusion one benefits from the pre-processing performed by its two predecessors, which act as if reducing the dimensionality of the data. This seems to be confirmed by the results of the Hybrid Fusion, which produces better results than the Early Fusion, but is still below the Late Fusion. This point could be explored by switching to classification algorithm less sensitive to the number of features. Alternatively, when considering the three SVMs used for the Late Fusion, one could see a simpler form of a very basic Multilayer Perceptron, in which each neuron has been trained separately (without system-wide backpropagation). This could indicate that using a regular Multilayer Perceptron directly on the raw features could lead to improved results, especially if enough training data is available.", "Regarding runtime, the graph-based approach takes more than 8 hours to run for the whole corpus, mainly because of the feature computation step. This is due to the number of features, and to the compute-intensive nature of some of them. The content-based approach is much faster, with a total runtime of less than 1 minute, for the exact opposite reasons. Fusion methods require to compute both content- and graph-based features, so they have the longest runtime.", "Besides a better understanding of the dataset and classification process, one interesting use of the TF is that they can allow decreasing the computational cost of the classification.

A two-class SVM can be extended into a multi-class classifier which takes the ordering of sentiment values into account, and implements ordinal classification BIBREF24 . Such an extension consists of two SVM classifiers: one classifier is trained to separate the negative examples from the neutral-or-positives; the other separates the negative-or-neutrals from the positives. The result is a classifier with two hyperplanes, which partitions the vector space into three subspaces: negative, neutral, and positive. During classification, the distances from both hyperplanes determine the predicted class. A further refinement is a TwoPlaneSVMbin classifier. It partitions the space around both hyperplanes into bins, and computes the distribution of the training examples in individual bins. During classification, the distances from both hyperplanes determine the appropriate bin, but the class is determined as the majority class in the bin.", "The complexity of Twitter data raises some challenges on how to perform such estimations, as, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no settled approach to this. Sentiment classes are typically ordered and unbalanced, and the data itself is time-ordered. Taking these properties into account is important for the selection of appropriate estimation procedures."], "predicted_answer": "unbalanced"}
