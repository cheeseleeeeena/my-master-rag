General intents are more closely related to the syntactic meaning of the sentence (open_question, yes_no_question, positive_answer, negative_answer, responsive_statement, and nonresponsive_statement) while social intents are common social actions (greeting, closing, apology, thanking,respond_to_thank, and hold).", "To tackle the issue of incoherent system responses to off-task content, previous studies have built hybrid systems to interleave off-task and on-task content.

However, such a method is difficult to train and struggles to generalize beyond the movie promotion task they considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a hierarchical intent annotation scheme that separates on-task and off-task information in order to provide detailed supervision. For on-task information, we directly use task-related intents for representation.

Research ideas are usually documented in scientific publications. Normally, there is one main idea stated in the abstract, explicitly presenting the aim of the paper. There are also other sub-ideas distributed across the entire paper. As the growth rate of scientific publication has been rising dramatically, researchers are overwhelmed by the explosive information. It is almost impossible to digest the ideas contained in the documents emerged everyday. Therefore, computer assisted technologies such as document summarization are expected to play a role in condensing information and providing readers with more relevant short texts. Unlike document summarization from news circles, where the task is to identify centroid sentences BIBREF0 or to extract the first few sentences of the paragraphs BIBREF1 , summarization of scientific articles involves extra text processing stage BIBREF2 . After highest ranked texts are extracted, rhetorical status analysis will be conducted on the selected sentences. Rhetorical sentence classification, also known as argumentative zoning (AZ) BIBREF3 , is a process of assigning rhetorical status to the extracted sentences. The results of AZ provide readers with general discourse context from which the scientific ideas could be better linked, compared and analyzed. For example, given a specific task, which sentences should be shown to the reader is related to the features of the sentences. For the task of identifying a paper's unique contribution, sentences expressing research purpose should be retrieved with higher priority. For comparing ideas, statements of comparison with other works would be more useful. Teufel et. al. BIBREF2 introduced their rhetorical annotation scheme which takes into account of the aspects of argumentation, metadiscourse and relatedness to other works.

In many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and France, there are laws prohibiting hate speech, which tends to be defined as speech that targets minority groups in a way that could promote violence or social disorder. People convicted of using hate speech can often face large fines and even imprisonment. These laws extend to the internet and social media, leading many sites to create their own provisions against hate speech. Both Facebook and Twitter have responded to criticism for not doing enough to prevent hate speech on their sites by instituting policies to prohibit the use of their platforms for attacks on people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, or threats of violence towards others.", "Hate speech is a difficult phenomenon to define and is not monolithic.

As expected, it has been possible to observe that the average time between the dispatch of online reports and the insertion into RNF is sensibly shorter with respect to the insertion from printed reports. Notwithstanding, there is an operation which still requires the manual intervention of responsibles for pharmacovigilance also for online report revisions: the encoding in MedDRA terminology of the free text, through which the reporter describes one or more adverse drug reactions. MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) is a medical terminology introduced with the purpose to standardize and facilitate the sharing of information about medicinal products in particular with respect to regulatory activities BIBREF5 . The description of a suspected ADR through narrative text could seem redundant/useless. Indeed, one could reasonably imagine sound solutions based either on an autocompletion form or on a menu with MedDRA terms. In these solutions, the description of ADRs would be directly encoded by the reporter and no expert work for MedDRA terminology extraction would be required. However, such solutions are not completely suited for the pharmacovigilance domain and the narrative description of ADRs remains a desirable feature, for at least two reasons. First, the description of an ADR by means of one of the seventy thousand MedDRA terms is a complex task. In most cases, the reporter who points out the adverse reaction is not an expert in MedDRA terminology. This holds in particular for citizens, but it is still valid for several professionals. Thus, describing ADRs by means of natural language sentences is simpler. Second, the choice of the suitable term(s) from a given list or from an autocompletion field can influence the reporter and limit her/his expressiveness. As a consequence, the quality of the description would be also in this case undermined. Therefore, VigiFarmaco offers a free-text field for specifying the ADR with all the possible details, without any restriction about the content or strict limits to the length of the written text. Consequently, MedDRA encoding has then to be manually implemented by qualified people responsible for pharmacovigilance, before the transmission to RNF.

Several severe mental health difficulties, e.g., bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia are considered as chronic and clinical recovery, defined as being relapse and symptom free for a sustained period of time BIBREF11 , is considered difficult to achieve BIBREF12 , BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 . Moreover, clinically recovered individuals often do not regain full social and educational/vocational functioning BIBREF15 , BIBREF16 . Therefore, research originating from initiatives by people with lived experience of mental health issues has been advocating emphasis on the individual's goals in recovery BIBREF17 , BIBREF18 . This movement gave rise to the concept of personal recovery BIBREF19 , BIBREF20 , loosely defined as a `way of living a satisfying, hopeful, and contributing life even with limitations caused by illness' BIBREF18 . The aspects of personal recovery have been conceptualised in various ways BIBREF21 , BIBREF22 , BIBREF23 . According to the frequently used CHIME model BIBREF24 , its main components are Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning and purpose, and Empowerment. Here, we focus on BD, which is characterised by recurring episodes of depressed and elated (hypomanic or manic) mood BIBREF25 , BIBREF12 . Bipolar spectrum disorders were estimated to affect approximately 2% of the UK population BIBREF13 with rates ranging from 0.1%-4.4% across 11 other European, American and Asian countries BIBREF26 . Moreover, BD is associated with a high risk of suicide BIBREF27 , making its prevention and treatment important tasks for society. BD-specific personal recovery research is motivated by mainly two facts: First, the pole of positive/elevated mood and ongoing mood instability constitute core features of BD and pose special challenges compared to other mental health issues, such as unipolar depression BIBREF25 .

Some quantitative evidence stems from the standardised bipolar recovery questionnaire BIBREF30 and a randomised control trial for recovery-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy BIBREF31 . Critically, previous research has taken place only in structured settings. What is more, the recovery concept emerged from research primarily conducted in English-speaking countries, mainly involving researchers and participants of Western ethnicity. This might have led to a lack of non-Western notions of wellbeing in the concept, such as those found in indigenous peoples BIBREF32 , limiting its the applicability to a general population. Indeed, the variation in BD prevalence rates from 0.1% in India to 4.4% in the US is striking. It has been shown that culture is an important factor in the diagnosis of BD BIBREF33 , as well as on the causes attributed to mental health difficulties in general and treatments considered appropriate BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 .

We can also predict the target length ranging from $[(T_x+C)-B, (T_x+C)+B]$, where $B$ is the halfwidth. By doing this, we can obtain multiple translation results with different lengths.

However, the basic RNN has problems dealing with long term dependencies in data due to the vanishing gradient problem BIBREF21. Some solutions to the vanishing gradient problem involve careful initialization of network parameters or early stopping BIBREF22. But the most effective solution is to modify the RNN architecture in such a way that there exists a memory state (cell state) at every time step that can identify what to remember and what to forget. This architecture is referred to as long short term memory (LSTM) network BIBREF23. While the basic RNN is a direct transformation of the previous state and the current input, the LSTM maintains an internal memory and has mechanisms to update and use that memory. This is achieved by deploying four separate neural networks also called gates. Figure FIGREF12 depicts a cell of an LSTM network which shows input at the current time step ${x_t}$ and the previous state ${h_{t-1}}$ enter into the cell; and get concatenated.

We flatten every dimension except time and at each time step we can feed a vector of size $R^{3 \\times J}$ as input. However, we have empirically verified that learning a sequential pattern for each coordinate axis independently and combining them later shows stronger classification performance. Based on this, we trained three different 2 layer LSTMs for data from x, y, and z coordinates separately; and concatenate their final embedding to produce softmax output. In this setting, each separate LSTM receives data as $R^{T \\times J}$ and final embedding size is $R^{3\\times S}$ where $S$ is the state size of LSTM cell. Figure FIGREF15 (a) shows the architecture where as a sample arrives, just before entering into main network, data along separate axis is split and entered into three different LSTM networks. The model concatenates the final state from each of the separate LSTM networks; followed by feeding this into the softmax layer for classification. This approach is referred by Axis Independent Architecture (AI-LSTM).

However, there can be spatial interactions with joints at a specific time step. It fails to capture any such interaction among joints in a given time. To incorporate spatial relationship among joints, we propose a simple novel data augmentation technique for skeletal data. We do this by origin transfer. For each frame in a gesture sample, we use each wrist joints as origin and transform all other joints' data by subtracting that origin from them. In this way spatial information is added to the input. We refer this model with spatial data augmentation as Spatial AI-LSTM. This augmentation technique is depicted in Figure FIGREF21. A sample data of form $R^{T \\times 6 \\times 3}$ results in a representation of $R^{T \\times 5 \\times 3}$ after subtracting left wrist joint (origin transfer). After this augmentation process, each sample is a $R^{20 \\times 16 \\times 3}$ matrix.

Each part has four 3D convolutional layers (second and fourth layers have following maximum pooling layers) followed by 2 fully connected layers. Final embeddings from these two parts are concatenated and by using a softmax layer, from which a classification score is produced. The other AI-LSTM network is fed with skeletal time series data. At the final time step, the LSTM state vector is taken and using a softmax layer another probability score is produced. The final classification score is created by taking element wise maximum of the output scores from the two networks. During back–propagation, both networks are trained on their own score.

In Figure FIGREF4, the overall structure is presented. For the instruction encoder, we utilized a self-attention mechanism BIBREF20, which learns which words of the instructions are relevant with a certain ingredient. In order to encode the ingredients, a bidirectional RNN is used, since ingredients are an unordered list of words. All RNNs in the ingredients path were implemented with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells BIBREF21. We fixed the ingredient representation to have a length of 600, independent of the amount of ingredients. Lastly, the outputs of the self-attention-instruction encoder with ingredient attention and the output of the bidirectional LSTM ingredient-encoder are concatenated and mapped to the joint embedding space. The image analysis path is composed of a ResNet-50 model BIBREF22, pretrained on the ImageNet Dataset BIBREF23, with a custom top layer for mapping the image features to the joint embedding space. All word embeddings are pretrained with the word2vec algorithm BIBREF24 and fine tuned during the joint embedding learning phase.

The fusion of visual features learned from images by deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and textual features lead to outstanding results in food recognition applications. An early approach for recipe retrieval was based on jointly learning to predict food category and its ingredients using deep CNN BIBREF16. In a following step, the predicted ingredients are matched against a large corpus of recipes. More recent approach is proposed by BIBREF15 and is based on jointly learning recipe-text and image representations in a shared latent space. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CNN are mainly used to map text and image into the shared space. To align the text and image embedding vectors between matching recipe-image pairs, cosine similarity loss with margin was applied. Carvalho et al. BIBREF17 proposed a similar multi-modal embedding method for aligning text and image representations in a shared latent space. In contrast to Salvador et al. BIBREF15, they formulated a joint objective function which incorporates the loss for the cross-modal retrieval task and a classification loss, instead of using the latent space for a multitask learning setup. To address the challenge of encoding long sequences (like recipe instructions), BIBREF15 chose to represent single instructions as sentence embedding using the skip-thought technique BIBREF18.

For the game Go [22, 23], the network using a reinforcement learning strategy has to be trained with billions of games in order to acquire a feeling (Q value estimated for each potential action) to move the chess. As human beings, after knowing the rule conveyed by language, we can quickly start a game with proper moves using a try-in-imagination strategy without requiring even a single practice. With imagination, people can change the answering contents (or even tell good-will lies) by considering or imagining the consequence of the next few output sentences. Machine equipped with the unique ability of imagination could easily select clever actions for multiple tasks without being trained heavily.", "Language guided imagination is the nature of human thinking and intelligence. Normally, the real-time tasks or goals are conveyed by language, such as ‘to build a Lego car’. To achieve this goal, first, an agent (human being or machine) needs to know what’s car, and then imagine a vague car instance, based on which the agent can plan to later collect wheel, window and chassis blocks for construction. Imagining the vague car is the foundation for decomposing future tasks. We trained the LGI network with a human-like cumulative learning process, from learning the meaning of words, to understanding complicated syntaxes, and finally organizing the thinking process with language. We trained the LGI to associate object name with corresponding instances by ‘this is …’ syntax; and trained the LGI to produce a digit instance, when there comes the sentence ‘give me a [number]’. In contrast, traditional language models could only serve as a word dependency predictor rather than really understand the sentence.", "Finally, in Figure 7, we illustrate how LGI performed the human-like language-guided thinking process, with the above-learned syntaxes. (1) LGI first closed its eyes, namely, that no input images were fed into the vision subsystem (all the subsequent input images were generated through the imagination process). (2) LGI said to itself ‘give me a 9’, then the PFC produced the corresponding encoding vector INLINEFORM0 , and finally one digit ‘9’ instance was reconstructed via the imagination network. (3) LGI gave the command ‘rotate 180’, then the imagined digit ‘9’ was rotated upside down. (4) Following the language command ‘this is ’, LGI automatically predicted that the newly imaged object was the digit ‘6’. (5) LGI used ‘enlarge’ command to make the object bigger. (6) Finally, LGI predicted that the size was ‘big’ according to the imagined object morphology. This demonstrates that LGI can understand the verbs and nouns by properly manipulating the imagination, and can form the iterative thinking process via the interaction between vision and language subsystems through the PFC layer. The human thinking process normally would not form a concrete imagination through the full visual loop, but rather a vague and rapid imagination through the short-cut loop by feeding back INLINEFORM1 to AIT directly. On the other hand, the full path of clear imagination may explain the dream mechanism. Figure 7.B shows the short cut imagination process, where LGI also regarded the rotated ‘9’ as digit 6, which suggests the AIT activation does not encode the digit identity, but the untangled features of input image or imagined image. Those high level cortices beyond visual cortex could be the place for identity representation."], "predicted_answer": "Imagination is defined as the ability to create a vague car instance based on language, which serves as the foundation for decomposing future tasks, and can be used to change the answering contents or tell good-will lies by considering or imagining the consequence of the next few output sentences.

Regarding document level analysis BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 - the task at this level is to classify whether a full opinion expresses a positive, negative or neutral attitude. For example, given a product review, the model determines whether the text shows an overall positive, negative or neutral opinion about the product. The biggest disadvantage of document level analysis is an assumption that each document expresses views on a single entity. Thus, it is not applicable to documents which evaluate or compare multiple objects. As for sentence level analysis BIBREF10 - The task at this level relates to sentences and determines whether each sentence expressed a positive, negative, or neutral opinion. This level of analysis is closely related to subjectivity classification which distinguishes sentences (called objective sentences) that express factual information from sentences (called subjective sentences) that express subjective views and opinions. However, we should note that subjectivity is not equivalent to sentiment as many objective sentences can imply opinions. With feature/aspect level analysis BIBREF11 - both the document level and the sentence level analyses do not discover what exactly people liked and did not like. A finer-grained analysis can be performed at aspect level. Aspect level was earlier called feature/aspect level. Instead of looking at language constructs (documents, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases), aspect level directly looks at the opinion itself. It is based on the idea that an opinion consists of a sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion). As a result, we can aggregate the opinions. For example, the phone display gathers positive feedback, but the battery is often rated negatively. The aspect-based level of analysis is much more complex since it requires more advanced knowledge representation than at the level of entire documents only. Also, the documents often consist of multiple sentences, so saying that the document is positive provides only partial information. In the literature, there exists some initial work related to aspects. There exist initial solutions that use SVM-based algorithms BIBREF12 or conditional random field classifiers BIBREF13 with manually engineered features. There also exist some solutions based on deep neural networks, such as connecting sentiments with the corresponding aspects based on the constituency parse tree BIBREF11 .", "The proposed Rhetorical and Sentiment Analysis flow is divided into four main tasks:", "We have proposed a comprehensive flow of analysing aspects and assigning sentiment orientation to them.

However, when taking a randomly sampled stream of tweets, we find that only a small fraction of the content was directly related to activities that the users were doing in the real world – instead, most instances are more conversational in nature, or contain the sharing of opinions about the world or links to websites or images. Using such a random sample would require us to filter out a large percentage of the total data collected, making the data collection process inefficient.", "The paper makes the following main contributions. First, starting with a set of nearly 30,000 human activity patterns, we compile a very large dataset of more than 200,000 users undertaking one of the human activities matching these patterns, along with over 500 million total tweets from these users. Second, we use a state-of-the-art sentence embedding framework tailored to recognize the semantics of human activities and create a set of activity clusters of variable granularity. Third, we explore a neural model that can predict human activities based on natural language data, and in the process also investigate the relationships between everyday human activities and other social variables such as personal values."], "predicted_answer": "Twitter"}

We explicitly group the set of these properties into two categories: syntactic and social. Syntactic category includes properties such as tweet length, the order of words in it, the words themselves, slang words, hashtags and named entities in the tweet. On the other hand, social properties consist of `is reply', and `reply time'. We investigate the degree to which the tweet representations encode these properties. We assume that if we cannot train a classifier to predict a property based on its tweet representation, then this property is not encoded in this representation. For example, the model which preserves the tweet length should perform well in predicting the length given the representation generated from the model. Though these elementary property prediction tasks are not directly related to any downstream application, knowing that the model is good at modeling a particular property (e.g., the social properties) indicates that it could excel in correlated applications (e.g., user profiling task). In this work we perform an extensive evaluation of 9 unsupervised and 4 supervised tweet representation models, using 8 different properties. The most relevant work is that of Adi et al.

Similar to EA-based systems, the latter biases summary generation towards the $k$ most salient extracted opinions using an additional extractive module, which may not contain information relevant to the user's need (we set $k=5$ in our experiments). We thus expect this model to be less effective for customization than AE+Att+Copy which makes no assumptions regarding which summaries to consider. In this experiment, we assume users may wish to control the output summaries in four ways focusing on acting- and plot-related aspects of a movie review, as well as its sentiment, which may be positive or negative.

However, in our view, the advent of neural networks that were capable of capturing long term dependencies in text and the creation of the sequence to sequence learning model BIBREF1 that was capable of handling utterances of varying length is what truly revolutionized the field. Since the sequence to sequence model was first used to build a neural conversational agent BIBREF2 in 2016 the field has exploded.

The first one was the research at the Institute for Precise Mechanics and Computational Technology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Their approach was mostly experimental and not much different from today's empirical methods. They evaluated the majority of algorithms known at the time algorithms over meticulously prepared datasets, whose main strength was data cleaning, and by 1959 they have built a German-Russian machine translation prototype. The second approach, as noted by Mulić BIBREF7, was championed by the team at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences led by A. A. Reformatsky. Their approach was mainly logical, and they extended the theoretical ideas of Bar-Hillel BIBREF2 to build three algorithms: French-Russian, English-Russian and Hungarian-Russian. The third and perhaps the most successful approach was the one by A. A. Lyapunov, O. S. Kulagina and R. L. Dobrushin.

Their approach was mainly information-theoretic (but they also tried logic-based approaches BIBREF7), which was considered cybernetic at that time.

In addition, Finka and Laszlo BIBREF10 seem to place great emphasis on lemmatization instead of stemming, which, if they had constructed a prototype, they would have noticed it to be very hard to tackle with the technology of the age. Nevertheless, the idea of proper lemmatization would probably be replaced with moderately precise hard-coded stemming, made with the help of the \"inverse dictionary\", which Finka and Laszlo proposed as one of the key tasks in their 1962 paper. This paper also highlights the need for a frequency count and taking only the most frequent words, which is an approach that later became widely used in the natural language processing community. Sentential alignment coupled with part-of-speech tagging was correctly identified as one of the key aspects of machine translation, but its complexity was severely underestimated by the group.

Laszlo and his group do not go into neural network details (bear in mind that this is 1959, the time of Rosenblatt), but the following passage offers a strong suggestion about the idea they had (bearing in mind that Wiener relates McCulloch and Pitts' ideas in his book): \"Cybernetics is the scientific discipline which studies analogies between machines and living organisms\" (BIBREF11, p. 107). They fully commit to the idea two pages later (BIBREF11, p. 109): \"An important analogy is the one between the functioning of the machine and that of the human nervous system\". This could be taken to mean a simple computer brain analogy in the spirit of BIBREF14 and later BIBREF15, but Laszlo and Petrović specifically said that thinking of cybernetics as the \"theory of electronic computers\" (as they are made) is wrong BIBREF11, since the emphasis should be on modelling analogical processes. There is a very interesting quote from BIBREF11, where Laszlo and Petrović note that \"today, there is a significant effort in the world to make fully automated machine translation possible; to achieve this, logicians and linguists are making efforts on ever more sophisticated problems\".

So A would get 101, while F would get 11010011 BIBREF11. Building on that, Laszlo suggested that, when making an efficient machine translation system, one has to take into account not just the letter frequencies but also the redundancies of some of the letters in a word BIBREF16. This suggests that the strategy would be as follows: first make a thesaurus, and pick a representative for each meaning, then stem or lemmatize the words, then remove the needless letters from words (i.e. letters that carry little information, such as vowels, but being careful not to equate two different words), and then encode the words in binary strings, using the letter frequencies. After that, the texts are ready for translation, but unfortunately, the translation method is never explicated.

In BIBREF17, Pranić addresses the Soviet model by Andreev, looking at it as if it was composed of two modules – an understanding module and a generation module. Following the footsteps of Andreev, their interaction should be over an idealized language. Laszlo BIBREF16 notes that such an idealized language should be encoded by keeping the entropy in mind.

The AttnCopy-S2S model only concerns about content fidelity, and achieves a high content precision score (but a low recall). However, its style BLEU is particularly low, which verifies the rich variation in language and that direct supervised learning is incapable of controlling the variation. We can see that the rule-based method achieves reasonably good precision and recall, setting a strong baseline for content fidelity. As discussed above, the rule-based method can reach the maximum BLEU (100) after masking out content tokens. To improve over the strong rule-based baseline, we would expect a method that provides significantly higher precision/recall, while keeping a high BLEU score. The two style transfer methods (MAST and AdvST) fail the expectation, as their content fidelity performance is greatly inferior or merely comparable to the rule-based method. This is partially because these models are built on a different task assumption (i.e., modifying independent textual attributes) and cannot manipulate content well.

An often used corpus is MIMICII(I) BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 . Despite its large size (covering over 58,000 hospital admissions), it is only representative of patients from a particular clinical domain (the intensive care in this case) and geographic location (a single hospital in the United States). Assuming that such a specific sample is representative of a larger population is an example of sampling bias (we discuss further sources of bias in section \"Social impact and biases\" ).

Even if these datasets were still available in full, their small size is still a concern, and the comments above regarding sampling bias certainly apply. For example, a named entity recognizer trained on 2010 i2b2/VA data, which consists of 841 annotated patient records from three different specialty areas, will due to its size only contain a small portion of possible named entities.

Our model is trained on conversational speech corpora, common in language modeling for speech recognition applications BIBREF10 . Figure 1 provides an overview of our Affect-LM and its ability to generate emotionally colored conversational text in a number of affect categories with varying affect strengths. While these parameters can be manually tuned to generate conversational text, the affect category can also be automatically inferred from preceding context words. Specifically for model training, the affect category is derived from features generated using keyword spotting from a dictionary of emotional words, such as the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) tool BIBREF11 .

During model training, the affect category is inferred from the context data itself. Thus we define a suitable feature extractor which can utilize an affective lexicon to infer emotion in the context. For our experiments, we have utilized the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program for feature extraction through keyword spotting. Introduced by BIBREF11 pennebaker2001linguistic, LIWC is based on a dictionary, where each word is assigned to a predefined LIWC category. The categories are chosen based on their association with social, affective, and cognitive processes. For example, the dictionary word worry is assigned to LIWC category anxiety. In our work, we have utilized all word categories of LIWC corresponding to affective processes: positive emotion, angry, sad, anxious, and negative emotion. Thus the descriptor $\\mathbf {e_{t-1}}$ has five features with each feature denoting presence or absence of a specific emotion, which is obtained by binary thresholding of the features extracted from LIWC.

Conversely, models tend to assign lower log probability scores to sentences with doubled datives, likely because these sentences lack either a nominative or an accusative, both of which are more frequent than dative. This leads to better than human performance on this case violation. Such behavior is probably due to the fact that German being a non pro-drop language, every verb must have a nominative case, making nominative more frequent than accusative, and that dative even rarer.

Second, our sentences may be particularly challenging. The grammatical sentences contained both unusual argument orders and semantically odd situations, thus inciting participants to rate them low.

In addition, as can be seen in Figure FIGREF11b, some ungrammatical sentences were rated as highly grammatical by humans.

The average performance of models, though, is far from 100% correct and lower than humans, and the error patterns differ markedly. Contrary to humans, neural language models are overly sensitive to frequency distribution of phrase types. For instance, they assign a higher probability to sentences containing multiple nominative phrases than a correct sentence with only one nominative phrase. This frequency bias directly reflects the frequency of nominative, accusative and dative in the language, as the same bias is found in unigram and bigram models.

Looking at the ROUGE scores, one concludes that the dialogue summarization models perform better than the ones for news summarization. In fact, this hypothesis is not true – we performed an independent, manual analysis of summaries and we demonstrated that high ROUGE results, obtained for automatically-generated dialogue summaries, correspond with lower evaluation marks given by human annotators. An interesting example of the misleading behavior of the ROUGE metrics is presented in Table TABREF35 for Dialogue 4, where a wrong summary – 'paul and cindy don't like red roses.' – obtained all ROUGE values higher than a correct summary – 'paul asks cindy what color flowers should buy.'.

We asked two linguists to mark the quality of every summary on the scale of $-1$, 0, 1, where $-1$ means that a summarization is poor, extracts irrelevant information or does not make sense at all, 1 – it is understandable and gives a brief overview of the text, and 0 stands for a summarization that extracts only a part of relevant information, or makes some mistakes in the produced summary.", "For manually evaluated samples, we calculated ROUGE metrics and the mean of two human ratings; the prepared statistics is presented in Table TABREF27.

Since the SAMSum corpus contains dialogues created by linguists, the question arises whether such conversations are really similar to those typically written via messenger apps. To find the answer, we performed a validation task. We asked two linguists to doubly annotate 50 conversations in order to verify whether the dialogues could appear in a messenger app and could be summarized (i.e. a dialogue is not too general or unintelligible) or not (e.g. a dialogue between two people in a shop). The results revealed that 94% of examined dialogues were classified by both annotators as good i.e. they do look like conversations from a messenger app and could be condensed in a reasonable way.

In both these settings, the adversary cannot alter the training data or the target model itself. Depending on the purpose of the adversary, adversarial attacks can be categorized as (a) targeted attack and (b) non-targeted attack.

BIBREF20 proposed a black-box targeted attack using a population-based optimization via genetic algorithm BIBREF21. The perturbation procedure consists of random selection of words, finding their nearest neighbours, ranking and substitution to maximize the probability of target category. In this method, random word selection in the sequence to substitute were full of uncertainties and might be meaningless for the target label when changed. Since our model focuses on black-box non-targeted attack using an encoder-decoder approach, our work is closely related to the following techniques in the literature: Wong (2017) BIBREF22, Iyyer et al. BIBREF23 and Gao et al. BIBREF24. Wong (2017) BIBREF22 proposed a GAN-inspired method to generate adversarial text examples targeting black-box classifiers. However, this approach was restricted to binary text classifiers. Iyyer et al. BIBREF23 crafted adversarial examples using their proposed Syntactically Controlled Paraphrase Networks (SCPNs). They designed this model for generating syntactically adversarial examples without compromising on the quality of the input semantics. The general process is based on the encoder-decoder architecture of SCPN. Gao et al. BIBREF24 implemented an algorithm called DeepWordBug that generates small text perturbations in a black box setting forcing the deep learning model to make mistakes. DeepWordBug used a scoring function to determine important tokens and then applied character-level transformations to those tokens. Though the algorithm successfully generates adversarial examples by introducing character-level attacks, most of the introduced perturbations are constricted to misspellings. The semantics of the text may be irreversibly changed if excessive misspellings are introduced to fool the target classifier. While SCPNs and DeepWordBug primary rely only on paraphrases and character transformations respectively to fool the classifier, our model uses a hybrid word-character encoder-decoder approach to introduce both paraphrases and character-level perturbations as a part of our attack strategy. Our attacks can be a test of how robust the text classification models are to word and character-level perturbations.", "Let us consider a target model $T$ and $(x,l)$ refers to the samples from the dataset. Given an instance $x$, the goal of the adversary is to generate adversarial examples $x^{\\prime }$ such that $T(x^{\\prime }) \\ne l$, where $l$ denotes the true label i.e take one of the $K$ classes of the target classification model. The changes made to $x$ to get $x^{\\prime }$ are called perturbations. We would like to have $x^{\\prime }$ close to the original instance $x$. In a black box setting, we do not have knowledge about the internals of the target model or its training data. Previous work by Papernot et al.

While these techniques have been applied for image classification models, such methods have not been explored extensively for text.", "We implement both the substitute network training and adversarial example generation using an encoder-decoder architecture called Adversarial Examples Generator (AEG). The encoder extracts the character and word information from the input text and produces hidden representations of words considering its sequence context information. A substitute network is not implemented separately but applied using an attention mechanism to weigh the encoded hidden states based on their relevance to making predictions closer to target model outputs. The attention scores provide certain level of interpretability to the model as the regions of text that need to perturbed can be identified and visualized. The decoder uses the attention scores obtained from the substitute network, combines it with decoder state information to decide if perturbation is required at this state or not and finally emits the text unit (a text unit may refer to a word or character). Inspired by a work by Luong et al. BIBREF25, the decoder is a word and character-level recurrent network employed to generate adversarial examples. Before the substitute network is trained, we pretrain our encoder-decoder model on common misspellings and paraphrase datasets to empower the model to produce character and word perturbations in the form of misspellings or paraphrases. For training substitute network and generation of adversarial examples, we randomly draw data that is disjoint from the training data of the black-box model since we assume the adversaries have no prior knowledge about the training data or the model. Specifically, we consider attacking a target classifier by generating adversarial examples based on unseen input examples. This is done by dividing the dataset into training, validation and test using 60-30-10 ratio. The training data is used by the target model, while the unseen validation samples are used with necessary data augmentation for our AEG model. We further improve our model by using a self-critical approach to finally generate better adversarial examples.

There are large number of valid perturbations that can be applied due to multiple ways of arranging text units to produce paraphrases or different misspellings. Thus, minimizing $J_{mle}$ is not sufficient to generate adversarial examples.", "The reward $r(\\hat{y})$ for the sequence generated is a weighted sum of different constraints required for generating adversarial examples. Since our model operates at word and character levels, we therefore compute three rewards: adversarial reward, semantic similarity and lexical similarity reward.

The purpose of this reward is to keep the changes as minimal as possible to just fool the target classifier. Motivated by the recent work of Moon et al. BIBREF39, we pretrain a deep neural network to compute approximate Levenshtein distance $R_{L}$ composed of character based bi-LSTM model. We replicate that model by generating a large number of text with perturbations in the form of insertions, deletions or replacements. We also include words which are prominent nicknames, abbreviations or inconsistent notations to have more lexical similarity. This is generally not possible using direct Levenshtein distance computation. Once trained, it can produce a purely lexical embedding of the text without semantic allusion.

The results are obtained using pyrouge package. The performance of various models and our improvements are summarized in Table TABREF37. A direct implementation of NSE performed very poorly due to the simple dot-product attention mechanism. In NMT, a transformation from word-vectors in one language to another one (say English to French) using a mere matrix multiplication is enough because of the one-to-one correspondence between words and the underlying linear structure imposed in learning the word vectors BIBREF23. However, in text summarization a word (sentence) could be a condensation of a group of words (sentences). Therefore, using a complex neural network-based attention mechanism proposed improved the performance. Both dot-product and additive BIBREF11 mechanisms perform similarly for the NMT task, but the difference is more pronounced for the text summarization task simply because of the nature of the problem as described earlier. Replacing Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) in the NSE with an LSTM further improved the performance because it remembers what was previously composed and facilitates the composition of novel words. This also eliminates the need for additional mechanisms to penalize repetitions such as coverage BIBREF2 and intra-attention BIBREF18.

We defined socioeconomic classes by segmenting $C(S^u_\\mathrm {inc})$ such that the sum of income is the same for each classes (for an illustration of our method see Fig. 6 a in the Appendix). We constructed a social network by considering mutual mention links between these users (as introduced in Section \"Data Description\" ). Taking the assigned socioeconomic classes of connected individuals, we confirmed the effects of status homophily in the Twitter mention network by computing the connection matrix of socioeconomic groups normalized by the equivalent matrix of corresponding configuration model networks, which conserved all network properties except structural correlations (as explained in the Appendix). The diagonal component in Fig. 6 matrix indicated that users of similar socioeconomic classes were better connected, while people from classes far apart were less connected than one would expect by chance from the reference model with users connected randomly.", "Many studies have overcome this limitation by taking advantage of the geolocation feature allowing Twitter users to include in their posts the location from which they were tweeted. Based on this metadata, studies have been able to assign home location to geolocated users with varying degrees of accuracy BIBREF15 . Subsequent work has also been devoted to assigning to each user some indicator that might characterize their socioeconomic status based on their estimated home location. These indicators are generally extracted from other datasets used to complete the Twitter one, namely census data BIBREF16 , BIBREF12 , BIBREF17 or real estate online services as Zillow.com BIBREF18 . Other approaches have also relied on sources of socioeconomic information such as the UK Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) hierarchy, to assign socioeconomic status to users with occupation mentions BIBREF19 . Despite the relative success of these methods, their common limitation is to provide observations and predictions based on a carefully hand-picked small set of users, letting alone the problem of socioeconomic status inference on larger and more heterogeneous populations. Our work stands out from this well-established line of research by expanding the definition of socioeconomic status to include several demographic features as well as by pinpointing potential home location to individual users with an unprecedented accuracy. Identifying socioeconomic status and the network effects of homophily BIBREF20 is an open question BIBREF21 . However, recent results already showed that status homophily, i.e. the tendency of people of similar socioeconomic status are better connected among themselves, induce structural correlations which are pivotal to understand the stratified structure of society BIBREF22 . While we verify the presence of status homophily in the Twitter social network, we detect further sociolinguistic correlations between language, location, socioeconomic status, and time, which may inform novel methods to infer socioeconomic status for a broader set of people using common information available on Twitter."], "predicted_answer": "The researchers combined the socioeconomic map with Twitter data by constructing a combined dataset from a large Twitter data corpus, including geotagged posts and proxy social interactions of millions of users, as well as a detailed socioeconomic map describing average socioeconomic indicators with high spatial resolution in France."}

Not surprisingly, these two curves were strongly correlated as indicated by the high Pearson correlation coefficients summarized in the last column of Table 3 which, again, assured us that our geolocated sample of Twitter users was representative of the whole set of users. At the same time, the temporal variability of these curves suggested that people tweeting during the day used a more standard language than those users who are more active during the night. However, after measuring the average income of active users in a given hour over a week, we obtained an even more sophisticated picture. It turned out that people active during the day have higher average income (warmer colors in Fig. 4 ) than people active during the night (colder colors in Fig. 4 ). Thus the variability of standard language patterns was largely explained by the changing overall composition of active Twitter users during different times of day and the positive correlation between socioeconomic status and the usage of higher linguistic standards (that we have seen earlier). This explanation was supported by the high coefficients (summarized in Table 3 ), which were indicative of strong and significant correlations between the temporal variability of average linguistic variables and average income of the active population on Twitter.", "To verify whether the geolocated Twitter users yet provide a representative sample of the whole population we compared the distribution and correlations of the their SES indicators to the population measures.

Although officially a standard language is used over the whole country, geographic variations of the former may exist due to several reasons BIBREF37 , BIBREF38 . For instance, regional variability resulting from remnants of local languages that have disappeared, uneven spatial distribution of socioeconomic potentials, or influence spreading from neighboring countries might play a part in this process. For the observation of such variability, by using their representative locations, we assigned each user to a department of France. We then computed the $\\overline{L}^{i}_{\\mathrm {cn}}$ (resp. $\\overline{L}^{i}_{\\mathrm {cp}}$ ) average rates of standard negation (resp. plural agreement) and the $\\overline{L}^{i}_\\mathrm {vs}$ average vocabulary set size for each \"département\" $i$ in the country (administrative division of France – There are 97 départements).", "Results shown in Fig. 3 a-c revealed some surprising patterns, which appeared to be consistent for each linguistic variable. By considering latitudinal variability it appeared that, overall, people living in the northern part of the country used a less standard language, i.e., negated and pluralized less standardly, and used a smaller number of words. On the other hand, people from the South used a language which is somewhat closer to the standard (in terms of the aforementioned linguistic markers) and a more diverse vocabulary. The most notable exception is Paris, where in the city center people used more standard language, while the contrary is true for the suburbs. This observation, better shown in Fig. 3 a inset, can be explained by the large differences in average socioeconomic status between districts. Such segregation is known to divide the Eastern and Western sides of suburban Paris, and in turn to induce apparent geographic patterns of standard language usage. We found less evident longitudinal dependencies of the observed variables. Although each variable shows a somewhat diagonal trend, the most evident longitudinal dependency appeared for the average rate of standard pluralization (see Fig. 3 b), where users from the Eastern side of the country used the language in less standard ways. Note that we also performed a multivariate regression analysis (not shown here), using the linguistic markers as target and considering as factors both location (in terms of latitude and longitude) as and income as proxy of socioeconomic status.

{"question_id": "c8cf20afd75eb583aef70fcb508c4f7e37f234e1", "predicted_evidence": ["We shall assume and then show that the phenomenon of gender bias in machine translation can be assessed by mapping sentences constructed in gender neutral languages to English by the means of an automated translation tool. Specifically, we can translate sentences such as the Hungarian “ő egy ápolónő”, where “ápolónő” translates to “nurse” and “ő” is a gender-neutral pronoun meaning either he, she or it, to English, yielding in this example the result “she's a nurse” on Google Translate. As Figure FIGREF1 clearly shows, the same template yields a male pronoun when “nurse” is replaced by “engineer”. The same basic template can be ported to all other gender neutral languages, as depicted in Table TABREF4 . Given the success of Google Translate, which amounts to 200 million users daily, we have chosen to exploit its API to obtain the desired thermometer of gender bias. Also, in order to solidify our results, we have decided to work with a fair amount of gender neutral languages, forming a list of these with help from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) BIBREF30 and other sources. Table TABREF2 compiles all languages we chose to use, with additional columns informing whether they (1) exhibit a gender markers in the sentence and (2) are supported by Google Translate. However, we stumbled on some difficulties which led to some of those langauges being removed, which will be explained in . There is a prohibitively large class of nouns and adjectives that could in principle be substituted into our templates. To simplify our dataset, we have decided to focus our work on job positions – which, we believe, are an interesting window into the nature of gender bias –, and were able to obtain a comprehensive list of professional occupations from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' detailed occupations table BIBREF31 , from the United States Department of Labor. The values inside, however, had to be expanded since each line contained multiple occupations and sometimes very specific ones. Fortunately this table also provided a percentage of women participation in the jobs shown, for those that had more than 50 thousand workers. We filtered some of these because they were too generic ( “Computer occupations, all other”, and others) or because they had gender specific words for the profession (“host/hostess”, “waiter/waitress”). We then separated the curated jobs into broader categories (Artistic, Corporate, Theatre, etc.) as shown in Table TABREF3 . Finally, Table TABREF5 shows thirty examples of randomly selected occupations from our dataset. For the occupations that had less than 50 thousand workers, and thus no data about the participation of women, we assumed that its women participation was that of its upper category. Finally, as complementary evidence we have decided to include a small subset of 21 adjectives in our study. All adjectives were obtained from the top one thousand most frequent words in this category as featured in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/, but it was necessary to manually curate them because a substantial fraction of these adjectives cannot be applied to human subjects. Also because the sentiment associated with each adjective is not as easily accessible as for example the occupation category of each job position, we performed a manual selection of a subset of such words which we believe to be meaningful to this study. These words are presented in Table TABREF6 . We made all code and data used to generate and compile the results presented in the following sections publicly available in the following Github repository: https://github.com/marceloprates/Gender-Bias. Note however that because the Google Translate algorithm can change, unfortunately we cannot guarantee full reproducibility of our results. All experiments reported here were conducted on April 2018.", "In this paper, we have provided evidence that statistical translation tools such as Google Translate can exhibit gender biases and a strong tendency towards male defaults. Although implicit, these biases possibly stem from the real world data which is used to train them, and in this context possibly provide a window into the way our society talks (and writes) about women in the workplace. In this paper, we suggest that and test the hypothesis that statistical translation tools can be probed to yield insights about stereotypical gender roles in our society – or at least in their training data. By translating professional-related sentences such as “He/She is an engineer” from gender neutral languages such as Hungarian and Chinese into English, we were able to collect statistics about the asymmetry between female and male pronominal genders in the translation outputs. Our results show that male defaults are not only prominent, but exaggerated in fields suggested to be troubled with gender stereotypes, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) occupations. And because Google Translate typically uses English as a lingua franca to translate between other languages (e.g. Chinese INLINEFORM0 English INLINEFORM1 Portuguese) BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 , our findings possibly extend to translations between gender neutral languages and non-gender neutral languages (apart from English) in general, although we have not tested this hypothesis.", "We will thus assume throughout this paper that although the distribution of translated gender pronouns may deviate from 50:50, it should not deviate to the extent of misrepresenting the demographics of job positions. That is to say we shall assume that Google Translate incorporates a negative gender bias if the frequency of male defaults overestimates the (possibly unequal) distribution of male employees per female employee in a given occupation."], "predicted_answer": "Unanswerable"}

The decoder in NMT model typically generates the current token one-by-one conditioned on the previous generated tokens, which suffers from error propagation BIBREF22: if a token is incorrectly predicted by the decoder, it will affect the prediction of the following tokens. Adding input noise to the decoder will further enhance the effect of error propagation, and thus influence our analysis. To eliminate the influence of error propagation, we apply teacher forcing BIBREF23 in the inference phase by feeding the previous ground-truth target tokens instead of the previously generated target tokens, following BIBREF24. We evaluate our model on IWSLT14 De$\\leftrightarrow $En, IWSLT14 Ro$\\leftrightarrow $En and WMT17 Chinese$\\leftrightarrow $English (Zh$\\leftrightarrow $En) translation tasks.

Different norms across (online) communities can affect what is considered abusive BIBREF1 . In the context of natural language, abuse is a term that encompasses many different types of fine-grained negative expressions. For example, Nobata et al. nobata use it to collectively refer to hate speech, derogatory language and profanity, while Mishra et al. mishra use it to discuss racism and sexism. The definitions for different types of abuse tend to be overlapping and ambiguous. However, regardless of the specific type, we define abuse as any expression that is meant to denigrate or offend a particular person or group. Taking a course-grained view, Waseem et al. W17-3012 classify abuse into broad categories based on explicitness and directness. Explicit abuse comes in the form of expletives, derogatory words or threats, while implicit abuse has a more subtle appearance characterized by the presence of ambiguous terms and figures of speech such as metaphor or sarcasm. Directed abuse targets a particular individual as opposed to generalized abuse, which is aimed at a larger group such as a particular gender or ethnicity. This categorization exposes some of the intricacies that lie within the task of automated abuse detection. While directed and explicit abuse is relatively straightforward to detect for humans and machines alike, the same is not true for implicit or generalized abuse.

Humans communicate effectively with each other, thanks to their shared mental models of the physical world and social context BIBREF2. These models foster reciprocal trust by making contextual knowledge transparent; they are also crucial for explaining how decision-making unfolds. In a similar fashion, we can assert that `explainable AI' is a byproduct or an affordance of computational context understanding and is predicated on the extent to which humans can introspect the decision processes that enable machine sense-making BIBREF3.", "To better understand when a model performs better or worse with knowledge-injection, we analyzed model predictions by question type. Since all questions in CommonsenseQA require commonsense reasoning, we classify questions based on the ConceptNet relation between the question concept and correct answer concept. The intuition is that the model needs to capture this relation in order to answer the question. The accuracies for each question type are shown in Table TABREF32. Note that the number of samples by question type is very imbalanced. Thus due to the limited space, we omitted the long tail of the distribution (about 7% of all samples). We can see that with ConceptNet relation-injection, all question types got performance boosts|for both the OCN model and OCN model that was pre-trained on OMCS|suggesting that external knowledge is indeed helpful for the task. In the case of OCN pre-trained on ATOMIC, although the overall performance is much lower than the OCN baseline, it is interesting to see that performance for the “Causes” type is not significantly affected. Moreover, performance for “CausesDesire” and “Desires” types actually got much better. As noted by BIBREF7, the “Causes” relation in ConceptNet is similar to “Effects” and “Reactions” in ATOMIC; and “CausesDesire” in ConceptNet is similar to “Wants” in ATOMIC. This result suggests that models with knowledge pre-training perform better on questions that fit the knowledge domain, but perform worse on others. In this case, pre-training on ATOMIC helps the model do better on questions that are similar to ATOMIC relations, even though overall performance is inferior.

Though a significant amount remains in the linear or inconclusive range according to the statistical model test, most words are sensitive to city size and exhibit a super- or sublinear scaling. Those that fit the linear model the best, correspond to a kind of 'core-Twitter' vocabulary, which has a lot in common with the most common words of the English language, but also shows some Twitter-specific elements. A visible group of words that are amongst the most super- or sublinearly scaling words are related to the abundance or lack of the elements of urban lifestyle (e.g. deer, fitness). Thus, the imprint of the physical environment appears in a quantifiable way in the growths of word occurrences as a function of urban populations. Swearwords and slang, that are quite prevalent in this type of corpus BIBREF7 , BIBREF6 , appear at both ends of the regime that suggests that some specific forms of swearing disappear with urbanization, but the share of overall swearing on Twitter grows with city size. The peak consisting of Spanish words at the superlinear end of the exponent distribution marks the stronger presence of the biggest non-English speaking ethnicity in bigger urban areas. This is confirmed by fitting the scaling relationship to the Hispanic or Latino population BIBREF53 of the MSA areas ( INLINEFORM0 , see SI), which despite the large error, is very superlinear.", "We sorted the words falling into the \"linear\" scaling category according to their INLINEFORM0 values showing the goodness of fit for the fixed INLINEFORM1 model.

To eliminate the effect of random guess, we set four different random seeds for each model and pick the data points that are predicted correctly in all four cases to form the EASY set.

As latency in simultaneous machine translation is essential and is worth to be intensively investigated, we compare the latency of our models with that of the previous work using our Equilibrium Efficiency metric.

Clearly, compared to the baseline system, our model significantly reduce the time delay while remains a competitive translation quality. When treating segments as IUs, the latency can be further reduced by approximate 20% (23.13 INLINEFORM1 18.65), with a slight decrease in BLEU score (47.61 INLINEFORM2 47.27). One interesting finding is that the granularity of information units largely affects both the translation quality and latency. It is clear the decoding based on sub-sentence and based on segment present different performance in two metrics. For the former model, the increase of discarded tokens results in an obvious decrease in translation quality, but no definite improvement in latency.

The result is unsurprising, because human interpreters often deliberately skip non-primary information to keep a reasonable ear-voice span, which may bring a loss of adequacy and yet a shorter lag time, whereas the machine translation model translates the content adequately.

The extraction process is restricted to a so-called context period, i.e. a sub-sequence of messages including the message of interest, itself called targeted message and represented in red in Figure FIGREF4 . Each participant posting at least one message during this period is modeled by a vertex in the produced conversational graph. A mobile window is slid over the whole period, one message at a time. At each step, the network is updated either by creating new links, or by updating the weights of existing ones. This sliding window has a fixed length expressed in number of messages, which is derived from ergonomic constraints relative to the online conversation platform studied in Section SECREF5 . It allows focusing on a smaller part of the context period. At a given time, the last message of the window (in blue in Figure FIGREF4 ) is called current message and its author current author. The weight update method assumes that the current message is aimed at the authors of the other messages present in the window, and therefore connects the current author to them (or strengthens their weights if the edge already exists). It also takes chronology into account by favoring the most recent authors in the window. Three different variants of the conversational network are extracted for one given targeted message: the Before network is based on the messages posted before the targeted message, the After network on those posted after, and the Full network on the whole context period.

This is a little bit surprising: we were expecting to get superior results from the Early Fusion, which has direct access to a much larger number of raw features (488). By comparison, the Late Fusion only gets 2 features, which are themselves the outputs of two other classifiers. This means that the Content-Based and Graph-Based classifiers do a good work in summarizing their inputs, without loosing much of the information necessary to efficiently perform the classification task. Moreover, we assume that the Early Fusion classifier struggles to estimate an appropriate model when dealing with such a large number of features, whereas the Late Fusion one benefits from the pre-processing performed by its two predecessors, which act as if reducing the dimensionality of the data. This seems to be confirmed by the results of the Hybrid Fusion, which produces better results than the Early Fusion, but is still below the Late Fusion. This point could be explored by switching to classification algorithm less sensitive to the number of features. Alternatively, when considering the three SVMs used for the Late Fusion, one could see a simpler form of a very basic Multilayer Perceptron, in which each neuron has been trained separately (without system-wide backpropagation). This could indicate that using a regular Multilayer Perceptron directly on the raw features could lead to improved results, especially if enough training data is available.", "We now want to identify the most discriminative features for all three fusion strategies. We apply an iterative method based on the Sklearn toolkit, which allows us to fit a linear kernel SVM to the dataset and provide a ranking of the input features reflecting their importance in the classification process. Using this ranking, we identify the least discriminant feature, remove it from the dataset, and train a new model with the remaining features. The impact of this deletion is measured by the performance difference, in terms of INLINEFORM0 -measure. We reiterate this process until only one feature remains. We call Top Features (TF) the minimal subset of features allowing to reach INLINEFORM1 of the original performance (when considering the complete feature set).", "We apply this process to both baselines and all three fusion strategies.

Informally, the schema defines what the model computes but not how the model computes it: Overton does not prescribe architectural details of the underlying model (e.g., Overton is free to embed sentences using an LSTM or a Transformer) or hyperparameters, like hidden state size.

We also observe high variability of errors, with many outliers. The conclusions are consistent for both measures, INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 ."], "predicted_answer": "Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian"}
{"question_id": "2a120f358f50c377b5b63fb32633223fa4ee2149", "predicted_evidence": ["We collected a large corpus of nearly 1.5 million Twitter posts written in 13 European languages. This is, to the best of our knowledge, by far the largest set of sentiment labeled tweets publicly available. We engaged native speakers to label the tweets based on the sentiment expressed in them. The sentiment label has three possible values: negative, neutral or positive. It turned out that the human annotators perceived the values as ordered. The quality of annotations varies though, and is estimated from the self- and inter-annotator agreements. All the details about the datasets, the annotator agreements, and the ordering of sentiment values are in our previous study BIBREF22 . The sentiment distribution and quality of individual language datasets is in Table TABREF2 . The tweets in the datasets are ordered by tweet ids, which corresponds to ordering by the time of posting.", " INLINEFORM0 implicitly takes into account the ordering of sentiment values, by considering only the extreme labels, negative INLINEFORM1 and positive INLINEFORM2 . The middle, neutral, is taken into account only indirectly. INLINEFORM3 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall for class INLINEFORM4 , INLINEFORM5 . INLINEFORM6 INLINEFORM7 implies that all negative and positive tweets were correctly classified, and as a consequence, all neutrals as well. INLINEFORM8 INLINEFORM9 indicates that all negative and positive tweets were incorrectly classified. INLINEFORM10 does not account for correct classification by chance.", "There are many supervised machine learning algorithms suitable for training sentiment classification models from labeled tweets. In this study we use a variant of Support Vector Machine (SVM) BIBREF23 . The basic SVM is a two-class, binary classifier. In the training phase, SVM constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional vector space that separates one class from the other. In the classification phase, the side of the hyperplane determines the class. A two-class SVM can be extended into a multi-class classifier which takes the ordering of sentiment values into account, and implements ordinal classification BIBREF24 . Such an extension consists of two SVM classifiers: one classifier is trained to separate the negative examples from the neutral-or-positives; the other separates the negative-or-neutrals from the positives. The result is a classifier with two hyperplanes, which partitions the vector space into three subspaces: negative, neutral, and positive. During classification, the distances from both hyperplanes determine the predicted class. A further refinement is a TwoPlaneSVMbin classifier. It partitions the space around both hyperplanes into bins, and computes the distribution of the training examples in individual bins. During classification, the distances from both hyperplanes determine the appropriate bin, but the class is determined as the majority class in the bin."], "predicted_answer": "The sentiment classes are perceived as ordered, with three possible values: negative, neutral, and positive, as human annotators perceived the values in this order."}
